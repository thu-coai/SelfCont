[ WP ] A story about a modern-day Roman Empire. <s> Summer. I had fond memories of summer- it was my halcyon days where I would sit next to the banks of the Euphrates and watch the river. Ebenezer would bring me sweets and sweets from the market, Little Caesar would help me pick up my own things. Maybe one day I 'd be able to eat all of them. All the while, the Romans were busy building their empire. With that in mind, I wandered through the city. What a beautiful day it was. You could see the rich houses of the city from up here. The verdant green fields and meadows were dotted with palm trees and meadows. Even the river flowed with rivers. What a wonderful day it was. Summer. Summer was my favorite day of my life.
[ WP ] On the day of their death, every human gets to have a vision of meeting the man they could have become. <s> Motor sport vehicles were the first to be outlawed. When you tell a man he has a day to live, it's an instant reminder of how little time he has left. The dilemma was simple. All vehicles had to be modified to accommodate their needs. Unfortunately, with so many people dying every day, a few companies decided to make an exception. All vehicles were equipped with fully functional monitoring systems. And so it was that every car, motorcycle, and minivan had a vision of their future. This, of course, only made the process more complicated. It took some time, but eventually, after nearly half a century, every car had a vision of their future. The average person's vision was only about one second, but that only took about ten seconds. Unfortunately, not everyone could afford a fully functional monitoring system. Of course, some companies made an exception. They could have made an exception for an entire generation of cars.

The initial stages of this process were relatively simple : build an army, train a few soldiers, and train them to fight for the empire. Of course, a more advanced civilization would have been able to do this by now, but in a way it was in no way advanced.

This year's festivities were in full swing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced that he would announce the end of the Purge tomorrow. Of course, some were skeptical. The news wasn't good. With so many people dying today, riots were breaking out across the country. Shouts of `` Zombies '' and `` Brains '' broke out across the nation. Prime Minister Netanyahu himself was quoted as saying that `` They're killing us all ''. Not only were the zombies attacking the cities, but they were also using their nuclear weapons. This wasn't good. The riots continued for days. My family and I watched from our living room. My mother was on the phone with my father, telling him that he should get a job and help out with the Purge. My father grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the house. `` There's nothing we can do! '' he said. `` The government has been doing everything it can to stop the zombies from coming out of their homes. The National Purge is happening today! '' My father had finally gotten his hands on a radio. `` This is breaking news! Reports are coming in that all the major cities are being overrun by zombies. Reports say that they have already begun their Purge. There are reports of cannibalism and disease in the streets. We 'll keep you updated as more information comes in. '' My father was right.

Sure, there were still fish and bugs but nothing like this. Sure, there were still beautiful women but most of them were just a bunch of dumbass kids with no idea what they were doing. Sure, there were still dragons but most of them were either dead or had been captured by aliens or something. I was on my way to visit my family in Seattle when I saw a man, no older than 30, standing on a bridge, staring at me. `` What the hell are you doing here? '' I asked him. `` A human is supposed to be on a bridge. '' He said. `` Look, if you don't mind me asking, why don't you come over and talk to me? '' I looked at him and then back at the man. `` Come on, just come over and talk to me. '' He said. `` My name is Steve. I'm from Seattle. '' `` Okay, okay. I 'll do it. '' I replied. I was about to walk away when he started walking away when he stopped. `` Wait, you're not going to talk to me? '' I asked. `` Of course not! I don't want to talk to you! '' He said. `` The reason why you're here is because of the human race. I'm from Seattle. '' `` Wait, what? '' I asked. `` The human race? '' `` Yes, that's right. You're from Seattle. '' `` Okay, okay. I 'll go over to your house. '' I said. I walked over to his house and opened the door. There was a man standing there with a gun in his hand. `` Who are you? '' I asked. `` My name is Steve. I'm from Seattle. '' `` Wait, what? '' I asked. `` The human race is extinct. '' `` Yeah, but why? '' I asked. `` Well, because humans aren't supposed to be alive.

[ OT ] I 'd like to take a moment to appreciate Sir Terry Pratchett. <s> The Embuggerance ( a short story, to be completed.. ) The noise sounded out across the courtyard, like a bull in a cage. Flickering lights flickered and sparked as if they were being lit by candles. Flickering shadows flitted across the ground as if the air was being sucked out of the building. All around, creatures, both human and animal, scurried about. Some had been caught in a trap. Others were simply walking on air. It was always going to be like this. I went over to one of the creatures and asked what they were doing. They just stared at me, silently. `` Not much, '' they said. `` How about we go outside? '' I nodded. They began to walk towards me, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they were being watched. The lights flickered again and then went out. They got closer and closer to me. The creatures started to scream and howl. The lights flickered again and then went out. They started to run. I was frozen in place. My eyes shot open and I saw a man running towards me. He had black hair and looked like he was wearing a suit. `` Hey! '' he said. `` Don't run! '' I screamed. `` He's coming for you! '' The man yelled back. `` Well, shit. '' I said. `` Where are we? '' I asked. `` He's in the courtyard! '' The man yelled back. `` Yeah, '' I said. `` Go back inside! '' The man yelled back. `` But I'm not going to go inside! '' I yelled. `` But I have to!

[ IP ] Red <s> The dark planet-like ship appeared from the lifeless darkness of space. Two mighty rings - one inner and one outer - spun in differing directions around the planet, its darkness a homage to the destruction it will bring on its inhabitants. What was once a lush green forest now crumbled to dust as it approached. Atop the ring, on a small rocky outcropping, stood a ring of stone. It had been carved into the rock by a man who, through trial and error, managed to find the right combination of elements. As the craft neared the planet, it was revealed that it was home to a race of beings who, through trial and error, had managed to create the perfect weapon. The weapon that would end the war once and for all. Not long after, a massive explosion rocked the planet, blasting chunks of rock and debris into the atmosphere. What remained was the charred remains of what once was a thriving civilization. `` We have arrived at your planet, '' a voice spoke from behind the ring. It was one of the first humans to arrive on this planet. It spoke in a language that had been lost to time. `` Oh great leader, you must be very pleased to see us. We are a proud race. '' The man turned around and looked at the ring. `` My people have mastered space travel. We have created wonders beyond imagining. And yet, you still stand here, waiting for us to return. '' The man chuckled. `` Indeed, we have. What is your name? '' `` My name is Ozymandias. I am the first human to ever reach your planet.

Meet and Greet/Question of the Week # 2 : When did you discover that you enjoyed writing, and why do you do it? <s> I've enjoyed writing since I was a small child, to be honest.

In fact, I think I'm going to start writing again this week. But first, let's talk about John. This week, I've decided to start writing in response to this prompt. In fact, I'm just going to give it a shot. In a few minutes, I 'll be able to answer any question you have. That's all.

[ WP ] You're a telepath and use the power to cheat on exams. One day you can hear the voice of the new teacher echoing in your head 'NO CHEATING IN MY CLASSROOM!'<s> Telepathy was the most powerful thing in the world. I still remember how excited I was when I first discovered it. So many people were talking about telepathy and all of them seemed to be completely wrong. As a kid, I tried to convince myself that it was all just my imagination. At first, I thought it was just my parents messing with me. That's when I realized that my ability was actually really useful. If I could hear the voice of someone else, I could actually make them think I was crazy. There were even rumors that telepathy could be used to cheat on exams. Of course, there were no tests or requirements for it. As a kid, I always had the ability to hear someone's thoughts. Even though I could only use it once a week, I still got plenty of practice with it. There were times when I even thought about cheating on exams. There were times when I even cheated on my own tests. My parents even made me sign up for some stupid test or program. There were even times when I even tried to convince them to let me use it. `` No cheating in my class! '' they would say. Of course, it was a little annoying to hear them say that, but it helped me pass the tests. One day, I decided to try it out. I took a deep breath and opened my eyes. `` Hello, '' I said. I looked around. It was all white. White walls, white floor, white chair. White bookshelves. White tables. White chairs. White... everything. `` Um... excuse me? '' I asked. `` Yes, hello. I'm here to cheat on my test. '' `` Good, '' I said. `` Wait, what test? '' `` Umm... In English class. '' `` Okay, good. So, you're cheating on your test. What's your name? '' `` Jason.

[ WP ] In Soviet Russia, ghosts fear you. <s> There was a small summerhouse my grandfather owned... a farm that we called our `` dacha. '' Most officials had a dacha, usually a simple retreat or a cottage at the edge of town. I knew better. Most of the time, they were just pieces of furniture and planks and decorative decorations. Today, however, was different. Today, the house had been converted into a living room. The paint was peeling away from the walls, the furniture was laying in piles on the floor, and the fireplace was lit by a single bulb. All of this, combined with the fact that it was night, meant that it was very dark. I wondered if my grandfather had left it there. In fact, I wondered if he had even been in the house at all. All I knew was that the peeling paint had looked like the rest of the furniture. What a strange place to live. Then, it hit me. This house had no windows. No doors. No locks. Just a simple wooden door with a knob. And, if you could call it that, a voice. `` Hello? '' I asked. The voice was deep and smooth, almost like someone had been speaking to me for the past few hours. `` Don't worry, '' it said, `` you're safe here. '' `` Are you sure? '' I asked. `` Yes, '' it replied, `` it's just... you know. '' `` Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've seen you? '' I asked. `` A few years, '' it replied, `` but not too long.

[ OT ] I 'd like to take a moment to appreciate Sir Terry Pratchett. <s> Across the Disc a shudder was felt. If anyone was to float through space alongside the Disc ( which would be quite a feat in itself and certainly impressive ) they would surely feel something akin to awe. But for those who were not in this situation, it was in fact rather unsettling. The feeling was akin to utter dread.

He was a little taller than me, and had red hair. He had black hair, but it wasn't quite black. `` Guilty. '' `` Very well. I 'll be your advocate. '' I stood up. `` Wait, what? '' Satan asked. `` Why would I be in charge of this case? '' `` Well, '' I said, `` how do you plead? '' `` Guilty. '' `` Very well. I 'll be your advocate. '' He smiled. `` Wait, what? '' `` You're not going to argue with me? '' `` Yes, '' I said, `` but if you would like to see a lawyer, please call me Greg. '' He walked away. I sat in my chair, and waited for Satan to come back. A few minutes later, he came back. `` Hello, '' he said. `` How are you? '' `` Fine, '' I said. `` Have a nice day. ''

While many scholars have debated whether or not the Romans were at war with us, it is clear that they did not fight for conquest or glory. They fought for what was rightfully theirs. Now, many scholars argue that the Romans were at war with us because they saw their own people as equals, and so they embraced the ideals of their ancestors. It is true that the Romans fought for many things, but the greatest thing they fought for was freedom. It was not until a young man named Augustus proposed to me that I began to understand the true nature of the Roman Empire. As a child, I always dreamed of becoming a soldier. So when I saw the young man standing on the battlefield, a feeling of pride overcame me. My heart ached for him, and I wanted to be there for him. When I walked into the room, the emperor's face was hidden behind a mask of fear. `` What is this? '' he asked. `` This is my son, '' I replied. `` Do you know what this is? '' `` Do you know why I am here? '' `` Because I was born to be a soldier. '' `` Then why am I in Rome? '' `` Because I fought for Rome. '' `` Then why am I in Rome?

Of course, my enemies were far more advanced than I was, and they wouldn't even be able to kill me with their magic. Of course, my defenses were strong enough to stop the horde, but my wizarding mind could not conjure up any spells that would allow me to defend myself. Then, one day, a small goblin appeared in front of me. It was at first I thought it was a troll, but then I realized that it was an actual goblin. As it neared me, it raised its staff and pointed at me. `` You are under arrest for violating the laws of this realm, '' it said. `` Yeah, whatever, '' I replied. `` As you can see, I am under the spell of levitation. The only way to do that is to use your staff. '' `` Why would you do that? '' I asked. `` Because I want to protect my home. '' `` That's not true, '' the goblin said. `` But if you don't want to be arrested, then why not just leave me alone? '' `` Because I can't control my staff, '' I said. `` That's why I'm here.

The reality is, they're not even that different from us. They have this strange ability to think for themselves, even if they can't see it. Sure, it's hard to tell if they're awake or asleep, but the difference is subtle. As far as we can tell, caffeine has been outlawed for decades. The FDA has yet to decide what is legal or illegal. While some people are still debating whether or not to continue the ban, some still believe that caffeine should be treated like a drug. Personally, I think that's an idiotic idea.

[ WP ] Criminals sentenced to death were never killed, but were instead `` repurposed ''. <s> I'm only guilty of one mistake, getting a little too angry. Also, killing my step-dad. In retrospect, I should have known better. See, that's why I did it. `` Suicides '' are, as you can imagine, very common in the criminal underworld. Not only do they kill their victims, but they also have the ability to alter the course of their life. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't realize that suicide is, in fact, an act of God. The first time I killed my step-dad, I was 17. He was, by all accounts, a good kid. Smart, athletic, and loved to play football. Unfortunately, the punishment for killing my step-dad was death. Because of this, I lived a life of crime. Sure, I could have done it differently, but it's not like I could change anything. Besides, that was all in the past. Not even my step-dad could do anything about it. Because of this, I lived a life of peace. Until one day, I decided to kill myself. There was no way I could have known that. `` Let me out of here! '' I yelled. The guards came running out of the room, and as they did, I realized that I wasn't going to die. Instead, I decided to end it all. `` Why are you doing this? '' one of them asked. `` I'm not sure, '' I replied. `` This is just a punishment, '' he replied. `` Oh? '' I asked. `` I thought you were innocent, '' he said. `` Then why are you killing yourself? '' `` Because I have no choice, '' I replied. `` Oh? '' he asked. `` Then why are you doing this? '' `` Because I am going to die, '' I said. `` Oh? '' he asked. `` Then why are you doing this?

[ WP ] Describe a magical place. No story, just the scene. <s> Magick's End marks the beginning of the end of magick. Seventy some odd hundred years ago, two of the most powerful mages took their hosts to a new world, one where they could be free. They had chosen a place where the land was fertile and rich, where no one could live without harming themselves. That place was far from perfect, but the inhabitants were content. This world was in need of their help, so they began the process of rebuilding. The oldest mage knew how to make the most powerful magick in a single day. He knew that a young man could have an entire village ready to be built within days. When he first saw the potential, he immediately began preparations. First, he had to gather as much land as he could from the surrounding lands. Then, he had to build as many houses as he could from the ground up. Finally, he had to gather as much food as he could from the ground up. It was a long process, but eventually the village would be ready. He knew that his work would pay off. One day, he saw a young man walking towards him. The man stopped in front of him, and looked at him. `` You are very good at what you do, '' he said. `` I'm glad to see you, '' the man replied. `` That's good, '' the man replied. `` Why are you so happy? '' `` Because I've been working hard for this village, '' the man replied. `` The others have too, '' the man replied. `` That's good, '' the man replied. `` Why do you think that I am so happy?

I've watched my siblings grow old and die. I've watched my children leave this world, one by one, without a care in the world. As I grew older, I realized that no matter what the people did, they were always better than us. Even if they had done horrible things. Even if they had chosen to kill themselves. Even if they had become corrupted by evil, even if they had created monsters and turned them into mindless drones, it was still better than them. Even if they had loved and lost their children, it was still better than them. Even if they had tried to save us, it was still better than them.

[ WP ] You use a public restroom, and the graffiti on the wall is a personal message for you. It tells you to... <s> `` Embrace your fate, open the paper towel dispenser? '' Orin stared for a moment at the message, then back at me. I was tempted to say yes, but it seemed like such a waste of time. It had been 5 years since I 'd seen him, and the last time I saw him was on my birthday. This time, he wasn't smiling. He was leaning back in his chair, completely still. The message, written in what looked like faded yellow ink, told me to open the paper towel dispenser. It had been so long since I 'd seen him. The idea of opening the paper towel dispenser had seemed so silly to me. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the message was a warning. A surgery. `` They're coming, '' I told myself. I began to walk towards the door. It was off limits to use public restrooms. As I approached the door, I noticed a small plaque on the wall, with the words `` OPEN THE WAPER '' written in yellow ink. The plaque read : `` To use this restroom, open the paper towel dispenser. '' The next day, I walked into the restroom. It was empty. As I tried to get out of the restroom, I heard a loud bang, and felt the ground shake. As I got closer to the door, I could see that it was broken. My heart sank. This wasn't right. The plaque said `` OPEN THE WAPER '' in yellow ink.

[ WP ] You and your wife wear rings that let you feel each other's heartbeat. Your wife dies and is buried with the ring on, and you always wear the ring in memorial to her. One day the ring turns on again... <s> I was a little bit surprised when the news broke, but at least it wasn't something that shocked me. At first I thought it was just some prank. There were no witnesses. My wife's funeral was held on Saturday, and there were rumors that there were more than a few people in attendance. At least the priest hadn't been killed. At least the pastor wasn't in a car accident. At least the family hadn't lost their loved ones. At least the pastor wasn't the one who got shot. The ring had turned on again. The day after my wife's funeral, I got up to go get breakfast. It was already late, and I hadn't eaten since lunch. I felt a little uneasy about going out. There was no way that my wife would be dead, so I decided to stay home. It was around 2 in the morning when I got home. I felt my heart beat faster. My heart was beating so fast that I could barely hear it. I checked my phone. The ringtone had changed. `` Hello? '' `` Bobby, are you okay? '' `` Yes, I'm fine. What happened? '' `` We were just playing games, and then the ringtone changed. I can't remember anything. '' `` We've been playing games all day. It's like we're in a video game. '' `` Bobby, what happened?

[ WP ] We live in a world where exercise causes our height to fluctuate rather than our weight... <s> All those celebrities, all like 'She's so tall and thin'or 'He's lean and mean ', make people think that they're taller than they actually are. I'm not sure if it's because I'm overweight or if it's because I have a problem with my height. What I do know is that when I turn 18, I will be given a choice. There is no such thing as an option. All the other options are equally bad. This choice, however, is one I can not refuse. So, as the clock strikes midnight, I prepare myself for the day ahead. In preparation for my 18th birthday, I prepare myself for the most important event of my life. On my 18th birthday, I will walk into the gymnasium. `` For fucks sake, '' I mutter under my breath. A few minutes later, the door opens and a man walks in. `` Welcome to the gymnasium, '' he says. `` The choice is yours, '' I reply. `` Fuck you, '' he retorts. I'm not sure if I really meant it. He walks up to the gymnasium and sits down. `` So, '' he says, `` how was your day? '' `` Hmmm... '' I reply. `` There was a lot of shit, '' he replies. `` A lot of people died. A lot of drugs, '' I reply. `` Why are you here? '' `` Because I have a choice. '' `` That's not what I meant. '' `` That's the problem, '' he says. `` It's the only thing that matters. '' `` Yeah, '' I reply. `` Why are you here? '' `` Because I have a choice. '' `` That's the problem, '' he says. `` It's the only thing that matters. '' `` Yeah, '' I reply. `` Why are you here?

[ WP ] You run an RPG pawn shop. You haggle with adventurers who try to sell loot they've acquired. <s> Introduction : I am Jericho The Covetous, king of kingdom Skyfall, the land of dragons. Before you reads this, I 'd like to say that I don't know how to play the game. Sure, I've played plenty of games before, but nothing compares to this one. Sure, I get paid a lot of money for these games, but what am I supposed to do with it? All I do is sit around and wait for adventurers to come in and sell me whatever they want. Unfortunately, it's not like I'm getting paid for anything. Then again, if I wanted to buy some gold or gems, I 'd have to wait until they came in and asked for it. Unfortunately, it's a lot of money, and if I'm not careful, I 'll have to spend it on other things. Of course, it's kind of hard to get anything done on my own, but that's what happens when you're the king of a kingdom. Yes, I've been playing this game for as long as I can remember.

[ wp ] after dying god informs you that hell is a myth, and `` everyone sins, its ok ''. instead the dead are sorted into six `` houses of heaven '' based on the sins they chose. <s> SLOTH I gripped my hand tighter as the pain in my arm subsided. As the swarms of demons poured out of the pit I could feel their eyes on me. As they approached I struggled to keep my balance. But as they did so I realized that the very essence of my being was being torn apart. In front of me stood a man in a black suit. He smiled at me and said `` Son, we have come to take you away from your sins. '' As he pulled me into the pit I could see his face had changed. It was no longer sad and angry but instead a deep sorrow. As he spoke the words I was taken back. `` Welcome to hell. ''
[ WP ] Trees are the resting place of a soul. <s> From behind the fence in our bedclothes we watched Gramma Wilkins on the rocking chair again, listening to the wind in the trees with the light on her like a beacon. She was out there somewhere, somewhere warm and inviting, just waiting for me to come home. My mother used to tell me stories about how she had once been a tree. They were the only stories I could remember of her, of how she 'd wither away and die, only to be reborn again, just like her mother. There was something about the way she smiled and talked, how she thought of me as her own child. And the way she held me close and whispered in my ear. It was as if I could hear her voice from behind the fence, just like my mother's. My father used to say that trees were the resting place of a soul. He said that they were a symbol of life, of hope, of life, of happiness. They were something I could never forget. As if the trees were my mother's eyes, my father's. As if the trees were my mother's arms, my father's arms. And as if the trees were my mother's fingers, my father's fingers. They were as if the trees were my mother's toes, my father's toes. And as if the trees were my mother's lips, my father's lips. They were as if the trees were my mother's tears, my father's tears. And as if the trees were my mother's fingers, my father's fingers.

But it was too late for me to fight. So I did what any other child would do. I kicked my feet up on the wooden floor. `` Go away, '' I 'd say. `` But don't worry about me. I'm not going to hurt you.
