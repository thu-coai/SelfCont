Her interest in the subject came from her father 's fascination with " sustained resistance to overpopulation " , and her friendship with Percy Chapman , a prominent Australian artist who lived in Ypres . Her paintings were influenced by Chapman 's rural landscape , the hilly countryside of the area , and the seclusion of the highlands . Her interest in rural life was further stimulated by her friendship with Ernest Rutherford , a prominent member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly , and by her friendship with Iain Macleod , a prominent Indigenous artist who lived in the city . <eos> Kipling 's works have been exhibited in an array of galleries across Australia , including the National Gallery of Australia , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Western Australia , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of South Australia , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Western Australia , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of Victoria , the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Art Gallery o

Previous to World War I , individual commemoration of war was generally limited to isolated incidents , and while individual organisations such as the British Army Memorial ( BAE ) and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ( CMRC ) were able to organise such events , their efforts at raising awareness of war dead did not achieve the same level of success as those of individual bereaved bereaved organisations . <eos> Following the outbreak of war , bereaved bereaved bereaved bereaved organisations started to organise their own memorials , some of which became known as war cemeteries . These cemeteries , which were usually located at war memorials , usually had a large number of war dead buried , and many of these cemeteries also contained cemeteries of servicemen killed in action . These cemeteries were usually decorated with carvings and medals , and the names of the dead were inscribed on the obverse side of the casket . The words " Of A Thousand " were often placed on the back of the casket , to commemorate the thousands of casualties that had been incurred during the war . <eos> Following the outbreak of war , bereaved bereaved bereaved organisations began to organise their own memorials , some of which became known as war cemeteries .

Gibson and Maurice Prendergast in their 1931 book The German Submarine War , 1914 â 1918 , the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down steamers while surfaced and lacked the speed to do so . Another problem was that while submerged , the pilot could not see or hear the ship 's engines . With three torpedoes available , and a range of about 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , this gave the pilot no means of knowing which ship was heading . The problem was solved by deepening the torpedo tubes , which were mounted on the stern of the submarine . In 1915 , Imperial German Navy submarines intercepted five British Type 42 surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( SAMs ) during a raid on Faslane , Norway , but they did not sink any of the ships . <eos> In May 1915 , Königsberg received an order to convert her into a minelayer , and so she was renamed Bernd von Arnim ( " His Majesty 's Ship Bernd von Arnim " ) . The ship was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November 1915 , launched in March 1916 , and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in August 1916 . She was armed with a main battery of eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns and had a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 8 mph ) . <eos> Bernd von Arnim spent her career patrolling the North Sea and occasionally engaged in surface action . On 31 May 1917 , she was hit by a torpedo fired by the British submarine HMS Salmon , which destroyed her steering .

Nevertheless , the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attaining consulships in each successive generation . The direct descendants of Capito were influential figures in Italian history and politics , often leading military campaigns and leading statesmen . Capito was the first person to be elected to the Senate , following his father 's death in 1597 . <eos> Capito 's political career began in the early 17th century , when he participated in the Battle of Ulcinj , where he and his fellow conspirators were defeated by the forces of Duke Ferdinando II . The following year , Capito was elected as a senator , serving under Ferdinando II 's son , Benedetto . During the reign of Ferdinando II , Capito rose to the rank of patrikios , the highest office in the Empire . He participated in the campaigns of Benedetto 's nephew , Alessandro , and became one of the most prominent politicians in Italy . <eos> During the reign of his father , Capito was involved in the defense of the Empire against the threat of a French invasion . In 1599 , he again led a campaign against Ferdinando II , but lost his position to him when he went into exile in Naples . In 1601 , he participated in the Battle of Brindisi , where he was defeated by his fellow conspirators . In 1603 , Capito again led a campaign against Ferdinando II , but lost his position to him when he went into exile in Rome . In 1605 , Capito again led a campaign against Ferdinando II , but lost his position to him when he went into exile in Naples .

and tetrapod ancestors differ from <unk> like <unk> in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater . <unk> like <unk> were among the first tetrapods to be discovered , and they shared the same diet as their relatives . However , their unique features , such as the ability to use the hind limbs as a prop for propulsion , and the flat @-@ topped mouth , made them difficult to swallow , so they were probably not used in suction feeding . <eos> The three families of tetrapods are known from rocks and fossils , including Euarchaea , which is sometimes considered the earliest known family of tetrapods . In 1980 , Bruce Mast and colleagues suggested that Euarchaea was a sister taxon to <unk> , but in 2007 Rolf Singer and colleagues confirmed this by noting that Euarchaea and Euarchaea were sister taxon to <unk> . Although the exact relationship between Euarchaea and tetrapods remains unclear , Mast and colleagues suggested that Euarchaea and tetrapods shared a common ancestor , which is consistent with the hypothesis that the family was closely related to the monotremes .

The name " tetrapod " is derived from the Greek words <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " meat " and <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " pores " . This was probably a reference to the wide range of pigmented pigmented tissue that covered the animal , which later became known as tetrapod tissue . This would have been useful in classifying the genus , since many animals are known to have had organs with highly pigmented pigmented tissue . However , this idea has not been widely accepted . The discovery of the first known animal in China , Shantungosaurus , in 1966 , may have been an early step towards the acceptance of the name " tetrapod " . <eos> In 1975 , Arthur Gamow proposed that the family was the first known extant family of tetrapods .

The method relies on information about the position of the variable and the possible values of its position relative to the object , as well as the information about the possible interactions between the variables and the objects . In this way , it can be used to determine whether a variable is associated with a particular object or whether it is an empty set of objects . <eos> The binary search technique was first introduced by Emanuel Messier in the late 1920s . In the 1960s , Robert Barr and Edward Chopp developed the technique for dealing with non @-@ zero values of a variable , using an array of binary variables as the basis of the search . In 1973 , Alan Turing developed the technique for dealing with zero @-@ sum numbers of binary variables . <eos> The binary search method has been used to analyze an array of objects of unknown origin , such as an empty set of objects or a transactinide element . It has also been used to analyze the interactions between variables and their associated objects . The binary search technique is sometimes referred to as the Shapley – Folkman theorem , although it has not been proven to be valid . <eos> <eos> = = Overview = = <eos> <eos> The binary search technique is a mathematical technique used to analyze the behavior of binary variables and their associated objects .

Cubitt and his wife Eliza had been involved in the construction of a hospital at Henbury Hill , which was completed in 1888 . Cubitt started work on the hospital in 1888 , and although it was not until 1903 that the hospital opened , the construction of the structure and the associated grounds were not finished until 1937 . The hospital underwent major renovations in 1965 , 1968 and 1971 , which included the removal of asbestos from the roof and replacement of the clapboard siding with a new one . In 1983 , the roof was replaced with a cast iron one . In 1988 , the roof was completely rebuilt , and the clapboard siding was removed . In 1991 , the hospital acquired a Grade II listed building status , which means that it is a " nationally important health centre " . <eos> The hospital also offers general health services such as general surgery , optometry , optometrics , gynecology , optonics , neonatal and child health services .

Claudius cast doubt on this confession and declared that Caligula was innocent . <eos> When Caligula returned to Rome , he requested that his father @-@ in @-@ law should be appointed as Caligula 's successor . This was granted , and Claudius immediately set about making a new arrangement with Caligula . He arranged for the two men to meet at the Temple of All Saints in Rome . On 25 January 41 , Claudius , Caligula , and Drusilla were married in the Church of St. Peter in Rome . The ceremony was conducted by a priest , who brought with him the remains of Caligula 's daughter Julia Drusilla , and arranged for her to be buried in the church . <eos> On 31 January 41 , Claudius made a formal announcement that he would assume the throne of Rome and assume the title of Augustus .

According to the Talmud , when Herodotus mentioned that Chaim I , king of the Jews , had given up his kingdom , Chaim replied that he had been exiled from Babylon and taken prisoner by the Babylonians . Chaim 's son Chaim II ( r . 168 – 195 ) was also exiled from Babylon , as Chaim II was said to have desired to be a Christian king of the Jews . <eos> Herodotus and Chaim II were contemporaries , and Chaim 's relationship with Chaim is the subject of scholarly debate . Chaim II is generally considered to be a close friend of Chaim , as he is mentioned in the Talmudic Bible as having forbidden his wife to marry anyone else , even if they were lovers . However , it is also possible that Chaim II was in fact Chaim 's son . <eos> Chaim II is also mentioned in the Gospels as having an affair with Herodotus , and it is possible that Chaim was romantically involved with him . Chaim II and Herodotus are also mentioned in the Book of Kells , where they both refer to Chaim as a " good man " . Chaim II is also mentioned in the Nativity at Nazareth , where he compares Chaim with Solomon , and in the Gospel of Luke , where he compares Chaim with Bacchae . <eos> Chaim II is also mentioned in the Nativity at Melchizedek , where he compares Chaim with Jesus , and in the Gospel of Luke , where he compares Chaim with Odaenathus .

The Catholic Church is the largest church in the Philippines , with nearly 1 @,@ 000 members . <eos> The historical history of the city dates back to 1630 when Portuguese explorer Pedro de Albuquerque visited the Philippines . He was impressed by the beauty of the countryside and considered it to be the " capital of the Indies " . Albuquerque and his wife settled in <unk> , a small village near Manila , in 1650 . In 1661 , they moved to Batavia , where they built a church and cemetery . In 1667 , they moved to Olongapo , a small city near Manila . In 1669 , they founded the Iglesia Filipina Independiente ( also called the Iglesia Church ) , which was one of the first churches in the Philippines . In 1672 , they moved to Vila Aquino Real , a small city near Manila . In 1674 , they founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ( LDS Church ) , which was one of the first churches in the Philippines . <eos> During the colonial period , Filipinos were encouraged to follow Roman Catholicism and follow <unk> teachings . The Jesuits brought Christianity with them to the Philippines , as did the Congregationalist missionaries who came to the Philippines from the Dutch East Indies . While most Filipinos followed the teachings of the Jesuits , they also had a strong sense of Confucianism . While most Filipinos did not follow the Confucian teachings , they had at least one ancestor who was influenced by Confucius . The Catholic Church developed in the Philippines during the reign of Emperor Ferdinand VII . <eos> During the colonial period , most Filipinos were taught by Jesuits who came from the Netherlands .

The organisation grew from a small number of men , including Glen Osmond , who were recruited from " gentry " such as Howard Marks , and Liam Brady , who were known as " studs " . At the same time , as the formation of the Clan Donald , many of the men associated with the organisation left County Antrim , as they did not want to be associated with a particular clan . <eos> In 2000 , the formation of the Provisional IRA ( UVF ) was announced in a meeting at County Antrim .

the Delville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Memorial by Newfoundland . The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Thiepval Memorial in 1932 , but without the erection of a permanent memorial , despite long delays . <eos> The County Council proposed a series of works to commemorate the battle , including a new street plan for the cemetery , and a link between the two sites . A series of cemeteries was opened in 1966 , to be named after the dead of the First World War , but their names were not used until 1988 . A similar scheme was proposed in 1981 , but without the erection of a permanent memorial . <eos> The Beaumont @-@ Hamel Memorial , which opened in 1966 , is dedicated to the memory of the battle and the men who died in the battle .

On the other hand , Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would have been suspect . <eos> The position of empress was strengthened by the death of Emperor Hadrian in AD 43 , which signalled the end of the independent status of the Empire and the beginning of a period of relative peace .

1894 , the German firm Krupp developed gas cementing , which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser Friedrich III , laid down in 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new ' Krupp armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted . <eos> Krupp cemented the underbelly of the older Indiana class with nickel steel and Muntz cemented the hull with transverse bulkheads . The two Indiana @-@ class ships were the first German warships to use nickel steel armor , though a few years later they began to use transverse bulkheads . A third type of cemented armor was introduced in 1906 , which increased the thickness of the main belt to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . This new steel armor increased the ship 's buoyancy by up to 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) , and its ability to withstand underwater hits increased to 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 068 m ) . The two Indiana @-@ class ships were the first German warships to be equipped with transverse bulkheads , though only one other German ship , Ostfriesland , was equipped with them . <eos> The two Indiana @-@ class ships were protected by a waterline belt that was 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick amidships , but reduced to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) abreast the magazines . The main battery gun turrets had the same thickness of steel plating as the older ships , but their roofs were raised 3 inches ( 76 mm ) above the waterline . The conning tower had the same thickness of steel plating as the older ships , but its sides were reduced to 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) . The torpedo bulkhead was also increased to a thickness of 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . <eos> <eos> = = Construction = = <eos> <eos> Indiana was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel in 1895 , launched on 23 June 1896 , and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 23 November 1897 .

. But overall Rosenfeld said The Portage " must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler " , forcing us to confront him " in a way hardly seen before in fiction " . <eos> The Portage was also the subject of the novel Hitler 's Army by Leslie M. Brynner , published in 1943 . Brynner , who had been an assistant editor at the New York Herald Tribune , went on to write a biography of Hitler , Hitler 's Life and Death , published in 1944 . In it he argued that Hitler 's death was caused by the incompetence of the regime , that the media had manipulated him , and that the real reason for Hitler 's death was the incompetence of the regime . He also pointed out that , despite his own personal failings , Hitler was an excellent leader and a brilliant strategist . <eos> The Portage is often cited as a major influence on the novel Hitler 's Army by W. H. Auden , who wrote in The New York Times that " to some extent , it sets off a certain kind of impulse for <unk> and open @-@ ended denunciations of the regime " . However , other critics have also noted that the novel is less successful than its predecessor , The Portrait of Hitler . The relationship between the two authors is unclear . According to Kenneth Clark , " both have been so concerned with details of the story that they seem to be willing to overlook or distort them , even if they seem to give them little or no insight into the nature of the relationship between them . " <eos> <eos> = = Themes = = <eos> <eos> As with other works by W. H. Auden , the novel is a Bildungsroman , in which the protagonist is driven to seek out and destroy all forms of human life . As Auden explains , " in Hitler 's Army , [ he ] goes into battle against an army that has been overrun by germs and pesticides , a land that has been plundered by diabolical men , and a city that has been turned into a playground . " The protagonist is driven to seek out and destroy all forms of life , including the Germanic peoples , which he discovers through listening to stories of beautiful women and children . <eos> For example , the protagonist is shown to be afflicted by amnesia and delirium , as well as hallucinations and " depersonalization " . He and his friend
were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross @-@ sectional thickness of limb bones in adult <unk> shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion . This indicates that the midline gait was the most efficient way to locomotion in this species . The solipsid mechanism used by some <unk> and sauropodomorphs has been proposed as a possible explanation for the climbing gait . The authors suggest that climbing gait adaptations may have evolved to compensate for the lack of adaptations in other dinosaurs . <eos> <eos> = = Classification = = <eos> <eos> This gait is one of the most primitive known gaitals , and the only one that can be considered a true gait . It is classified in the family Carnivora , along with the related sauropodomorphs Daspletosaurus , Holochilus , and Lorisaurus . The genus name " Daspletosaurus " is derived from the Greek words <unk> ( " claw " ) and <unk> ( " face " ) . The specific name comes from the Ancient Greek words <unk> ( " without claws " ) and <unk> ( " lizard " ) . The common names for this gait include the " upturned ram " , the " perch @-@ like " , the " round lizard " , the " duck @-@ like " , the " naked one " , the " frilled one " , the " hairy one " , the " earthy one " , the " oriental one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " true one " , the " little one " , the " curving one " , the " earthy one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " hairy one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " oriental fringe " , the " true one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " true one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " true one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " true one " , the " oriental fringe " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one " , the " true one

seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a " space @-@ frame " , was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . A number of works from this period have been attributed to van Eyck , including Ariel , The Dream of Gerontius , The Crucifixion of Jesus , and Prayers for the Dead . <eos> During the 1920s and 1930s , the use of perspective became increasingly prominent in German art , especially during the period when painters such as Friedrich Lichtenstein and Jan Matejko were developing a style that emphasized movement , even though they emphasised <unk> . This was particularly evident in Britten 's 1926 painting The Mountain View , which combined a number of elements from perspective with shadow . With this work , Britten combined a number of spatial techniques with abstract expressionism , including recreating shadows with depth and spatial relationships . This resulted in a number of works that have been described as " deeply informed " by the visual arts . <eos> During the 1930s , painters such as Friedrich Lichtenstein and Jan Matejko developed a style that emphasized movement , particularly through the use of perspective . This was particularly evident in Britten 's 1931 painting The Fountainhead , which combined a number of spatial techniques with shadow . With this work , Britten combined elements of perspective with shadow , and developed a number of works that have been described as " deeply informed " by the visual arts . <eos> During the 1940s , painters such as Alfred Dürer and Heinrich Bülow were developing a style that emphasized movement , particularly through the use of perspective .

problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport . <eos> On 4 January , several incidents , including a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the morning of 5 January . The reason for this was that , at noon , when the fighting began , the fighting stopped and an estimated 1 @,@ 000 Somalis were killed , in addition to seven Australians . This number rose to around 3 @,@ 000 by 5 January . <eos> In addition to the initial clashes , and particularly the fighting around Lone Pine , several other incidents occurred during the day . On 5 January , an Australian soldier was killed when his vehicle was hit by a grenade , while another Australian soldier was killed when he was hit by a mine while trying to cross a road near a village . The next day , another Australian soldier was killed when he was hit by a grenade while trying to cross a road near a minefield . In addition , on 6 January , another Australian soldier was killed when he was hit by a grenade while trying to cross a road near a minefield . <eos> Following the fighting around Lone Pine , the situation at the embassy grew worse . On 5 January , Australian soldiers were sent to quell an attack on a group of Somalis who had been gathering at a nearby village . The Australians succeeded in repelling the attack , but in the following days , as the fighting continued , Australian troops also clashed with Somalis in the vicinity of Lone Pine . In February , Australian soldiers were involved in a skirmish with a group of Somalis who had assembled at a nearby hilltop . This resulted in several casualties , including one killed and five wounded . <eos> Following the fighting around Lone Pine , Australian forces conducted an operation to clear the area of the Somalis , which was called off after clashes between Australian and Somalis alike .

= <eos> <eos> Napoleon had calculated that Kutuzov would withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . Consequently , Napoleon ordered a retreat , in which Kutuzov 's army would be encircled and annihilated . The Imperial Guard retreated from Vienna , followed by the Russian Imperial Guard , which retreated into Basel . Napoleon himself was captured by the Austrian army at the Battle of Crécy on 21 June 1805 . <eos> Napoleon then moved his forces south , through southern France , through Toulouse , and across the Pyrenees to Basel . The French were able to capture Élisabeth of Luxembourg in July 1805 , but failed to do so in time to stop the Austrians from advancing south into Switzerland . Napoleon then turned his attention to Ancona , where he had been waiting for a few days . Napoleon sent most of his army south , which was surrounded by Austrian troops , but at nightfall on 23 July , Napoleon 's main force arrived at the Battle of the Somme . <eos> The French retreated into Switzerland and occupied Ancona on 1 August 1805 . Napoleon then turned his attention to Massena , where he had formed a strong defensive position , first at Elbe , then at Schwyz , and finally at Zurich . Napoleon 's main army was stationed in Switzerland , commanded by Marshal Ney . Ney , who had been promoted to general on 21 June , now turned his attention to the Austrian rear . He planned to cross the Rhine at Langenburg , but Ney failed to do so , as he had failed to do so at Ulm . <eos> Napoleon then moved his army south , across the Rhine at Mainz , and across the Danube at Verrières . The French , however , were not able to advance far enough to stop the Austrians from advancing south into Switzerland . On 24 August , Napoleon sent a small force to Nassau , where he had encircled the main Austrian army , but failed to do so .

The open @-@ ended nature of it has been compared to Stanley Johnson 's theories about goal scoring , and I think that 's what makes it work . " <eos> A number of commentators have noted that Elgin and Morrison have developed a strong relationship , both coaching and mentoring . In the early 2000s , Morrison was quoted as saying that " a lot of people have gone through this and said , ' How can you motivate people to play hockey ? ' But they haven 't . They just want to be able to give you what you want . " In 2003 , Elgin and Morrison were inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame . <eos> <eos> = = Career statistics = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = Regular season and playoffs = = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = International = = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = Awards = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = Management career = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = Florida Panthers = = = <eos> <eos> Elgin was selected by the Panthers in the sixth round , 27th overall , of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft .

; and thirdly , by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency . The result was that there were about 2 @,@ 000 nationalist families , and practically no unionists , on the housing waiting list , and that housing in the nationalist area was overwhelmingly owned by landlords . <eos> Most of the non @-@ unionist residents of Ward , who had been living in South Ward since before the war , moved to the new constituency , which had formed part of the London Borough of Hillingdon in 1974 . This had the potential to become a significant centre of nationalist activity , but Ward residents were reluctant to move outside the South Ward , and as a result most lived in council housing , which were generally owned by the landlords . <eos> As a result , a number of local authorities set up " Supernumerary Housing Authorities " ( SUPA ) to deal with the problem . The first was the London Borough of Hillingdon ( which at the time was part of the London Metropolitan Borough of Hillingdon ) , which at the time was also known as the London Poor Law Union ( LUCU ) . At the same time , a number of independent local authorities were set up in the area , including the London County Council ( later renamed the London Poor Law Union ) , which was established in 1974 . <eos> As a result of the electoral system , the majority of residents in Ward lived in council housing , and up to a quarter lived in non @-@ council housing . The largest number of residents were housed in council housing , which had a population of around 2 @,@ 000 . A further 1 @,@ 300 lived in non @-@ council housing , mostly in the South Ward , which had a population of less than 500 . <eos> In a report published in 1992 , the LUCU stated that : <eos> A number of reasons have been suggested for the low population density of the ward , including a combination of factors such as unfavourable local government policies , inadequate provision of housing and long @-@ term infrastructure , and policy interference with planning permission .

against his life . <eos> Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected , and while Emperor Augustus initially favoured curbing Roman liberties , he eventually favoured sweeping changes to the constitution . The most significant of these was the adoption of a new tax code , which created a bureaucracy that increased the number of senators and curtailed the powers of the Senate . Although Augustus initially opposed this , he eventually agreed to do so , moving the capital from Ulthien to Compiègne . <eos> Despite these efforts , Nerva 's reign was marked by further unrest and civil unrest . The first significant revolt occurred in 451 , when rebels attacked the palace of Diocletian in Rhodes . Although this was a relatively minor incident , it provoked further unrest in Rome , which culminated in the sack of Rome in 458 . In 451 , Emperor Augustus again attempted to suppress the revolt , but this time he instead ordered a crackdown on those who supported the rebels . The most significant revolt occurred in 458 , when rebels attacked the imperial palace of Vespasian in Dalmatia . Although Augustus initially supported the rebels , he later reversed his stance and allowed them to continue fighting . <eos> Following the sack of Rome , Augustus was forced to intervene in what became known as the " civil war " . In 451 , the Roman Senate again revolted against the Emperor , this time against his son @-@ in @-@ law Marcus Licinius Crassus . Crassus 's revolt had been suppressed by Augustus in 451 , but it was again suppressed by the Senate in 451 .

The fighting around Koli Point ultimately cost the Americans dearly , as they lost 18 killed and 29 wounded in the battle . <eos> Although the fighting around Koli Point had been relatively quiet , several incidents occurred during the battle . Japanese forces attempted to seize a number of American prisoners of war during the battle , but they were unable to do so because of a lack of ammunition and manpower . In addition , several Americans were killed or wounded during the battle .

She was launched on 26 June 1893 , and completed in December 1895 . In 1897 , she was assigned to the Channel Fleet , along with her sister ship Somerset . In 1898 , she was transferred to the China Station , where she operated until 1900 . She served as a training ship until 1903 , when she was placed in reserve .

Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , kept them in good condition . <eos> Two major changes occurred during the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 .

Two years later , a new design was adopted , and a variation of the old armored cruiser armored cruiser Brennus was built . This armored cruiser @-@ type design retained the same basic layout of the previous designs , but with slight modifications .

The genus name , Nephropsittacus , is derived from the Latin word <unk> , meaning " mouth " . The fossil record indicates that these were herbivores that specialized in eating small vertebrates , like snails and slugs . This classification has been challenged by recent studies , which have shown that they are more closely related to diurnal and ambush predators than to gastropods . <eos> Nephropsittacus was the first known large tetrapod , and is sometimes considered a separate genus . It is classified in the section <unk> of the Prosaurolophinae , a grouping of extinct animals that includes ankylosaurids , crocodylomorphs , hyraxes , hyraxes , mastodons , and mastodons . The family <unk> , which includes all members of the order Hypsittacus , is thought to have been an early member of the family <unk> .

The goal was to create a force capable of destroying heavy tanks , but their development was hampered by a lack of funds and materiel . Between 1941 and 1943 , at least two batches of M3A1 Abrams tanks were produced , each with its own specifications , although these had been modified to fit different specifications . <eos> The first batch of M3A1s was delivered in 1942 , and production began in 1943 . Although the tank produced relatively quickly , it was not until after the war that the Soviet tank force experienced rapid growth . Production of M3A1s began in 1944 , and they were used extensively in the Soviet tank battle of Manchuria , where they proved effective against German armor . The production of M3A1s continued until the end of the war , when they were withdrawn from Poland in 1945 . <eos> In 1951 , after the end of the Second World War , the German government decided to build a large tank force to counter the growing number of Soviet tanks . This force , known as the Tetrarchs , was intended to be armed with M3A1s , but after the war it was decided that it would be too expensive to produce them , and instead the Soviet government decided to use M3A1s instead .

At the time of its founding , Chiapas was part of the kingdom of Mixco Viejo , which stretched from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico . The city flourished under the Kaqchikel until the late Classic Period , when it was conquered by the Peculiar dynasty . At the time of its conquest , Chiapas was in a state of decline , and only one Kaqchikel lord remained . <eos> In 751 BC , during the reign of King Yuknoom Che 'en K 'awiil , the city of Chiapas was conquered by the Chontal Maya . The inhabitants were forced to pay tribute to the Kaqchikel king and his family , who resided in the city . At the time of the conquest , the city was under the control of the Medeo people , who had been allied with the rival Chontal Maya kingdom of Dos Pilas . At the time of the conquest , the city was under the control of the Uaxactun Uca people , who were allied with the Medeo people . The Uaxactun Uca king resided in the city until his death in 753 BC . <eos> During the Late Preclassic period , the Kaqchikel kingdom began to decline .

Lee Parsons contests John Graham 's identification of Monument 23 as a re @-@ carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identified by Graham as ears , as rather the scrolled eyes of an open @-@ jawed lion . <eos> Although most of the surviving monuments were erected by an unknown architect , <unk> speculates that at least one such monument was erected by an unknown person . This theory is supported by a number of sources , including Bowers 's work on the Valley View Memorial , which includes monuments to Lyell , Babcock , and Ross , and a letter from Edwin McMillan to Edwin Holmes in 1857 . It has been suggested that this was the work of a young man who may have seen monuments erected by an unknown architect , but this is not supported by evidence . <eos> <eos> = = Location = = <eos> <eos> Monument 23 is located at the southern end of the Valley View Memorial , about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) south of Broome , New York . The monument was erected by an unknown architect in the late 17th century , and stands on a hillside overlooking the valley . It was the first known structure to be erected by an unknown architect , and the only one to be completely destroyed by fire . <eos> The monument is surrounded by a series of stone steps leading up to the top of the hill . This leads to a small courtyard that houses the interior of the building . This courtyard contains a number of rooms that were used for " study " or storage , and was the location of the family home of Daniel Boone . This room is also the location of the tomb of Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall , who died in 1790 . The room contains a portrait of Daniel Boone and the words " Good God Save the King " , which were engraved on the wall of the room . This portrait is believed to have been taken by an unknown artist , who may have included some information about the family 's activities in New York . <eos> The monument was built by a young man who lived in the valley , and lived at the time of its construction . He may have seen the structure , which is now known as a " school " , as it was intended to be used as a classroom . This is not supported by evidence , but it may have been constructed by a man who lived in the vicinity of the school . The building is surrounded b

In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to release a sequel to Paranoid Park on DVD , as they had done with Disney 's Sleeping Beauty . The studio instead opted to use the same technology and chose to use Dolby Surround Sound , which was used in the first film . <eos> A number of other features were added to the game . For example , the weather map of Paranoid Park is shown on the map of Earth , while the characters navigate through a series of landscapes in the background . The camera system was also improved , with the ability to focus on objects such as church bells , carriages , and power cables . On top of this , the characters can now see an asteroid in the sky . <eos> The game 's soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman , who had previously worked on an animated film based on <unk> 's work . A number of songs were also composed by Puerto Rican singer Ivy Queen .

the United States Copyright Office for the work . It assigned the copyright to Steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting . <eos> <eos> = = Detail = = <eos> <eos> The illustration is split in two by a single line , which points out the gap between the two sides of the canvas . This design was used for the London edition of Intimate Scenes , published in 1883 . In this work , the artist shows two men kissing in a room of mirrors , and their hands are shown behind them . This is also seen in the later print , which also shows a woman holding a mirror . The image of the two men , in a single pose , looks like a series of scenes from an earlier work , but this time it is not . <eos> The caption to the painting reads : <eos> Though our present view of this subject is somewhat uncertain , it seems to me that it should be considered as the most probable one . I have seen many pictures of scenes from earlier works , and it is probable that they were intended to show a man kissing a woman , but I do not believe that they are necessarily intended to be so . The idea is therefore that the two men should be seated together , as if they were lovers , and the image of the two men , though somewhat different , should be taken to mean that they are the same person . <eos> The caption to the painting , however , was not included in the later print , and has been interpreted as referring to the scene in which the two men kiss . This interpretation is based on a letter written by an anonymous person to a friend of the artist , who claimed that the artist had used the caption to " express his feelings about the subject " . This is also seen in the later print , which also shows a woman holding a mirror . <eos> <eos> = = Interpretation = = <eos> <eos> The idea of the two men kissing is the subject of several interpretations .

The binary search , in which a number of variables are searched for a given object , can be done by performing a search with the normal operations of the operation , such as taking a single line of data and returning it to the next logical point . <eos> The binary search was first introduced by Emanuel Messerschmitt in 1887 , when he attempted to compute the position of a binary variable using a special set of rules . A similar method was used by V. S. Reinhardt in 1951 , when he attempted to compute the position of a binary variable using a special set of rules . In 1974 , Messerschmitt 's method was extended to include binary search operations , which are now used by commercial software programs . <eos> The binary search has been criticized for its poor performance , and for its reliance on associative arrays .

Initially the Commission drew its members from the ranks of the Royal Navy , but following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , a number of officers were appointed . At the same time , a separate commission was created to investigate potential grave sites , with an initial report being submitted in 1915 . The Commission drew its members from the ranks of the Army , Navy and Air Force , and it drew its conclusions from these sources . At the same time , the Military Board was established to investigate possible military sites , with the purpose of determining if any such sites were suitable for burials . <eos> The first graves commission produced recommendations on the design and construction of burials , with the majority of burials being located in the vicinity of a military base . Following the outbreak of war in 1914 , the Commission reported that their recommendations had been " largely ignored " , and recommended that military sites should be built along the lines of those proposed by the Military Board . In 1915 , the Commission also drew its recommendations on the placement of military installations , with the majority of burials being located in a location within a radius of 10 miles ( 16 km ) of the base . The following year , the Commission recommended that military bases should be built along the lines of those proposed by the Military Board , but this recommendation was not implemented . <eos> In 1917 , the Commission reported that " their conclusions were largely ignored " , and recommended that military bases should be constructed along the lines of those proposed by the Military Board .

the Roman people , support for Domitian remained strong in the army , which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard , Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Niger as regent in February 480 , and replaced him with Marcus Aurelius Crassus . The Senate refused to accept this change , however , and a rebellion broke out in Thessaly in March 480 . This led to the overthrow of the Praetorian Guard by a coalition of conspirators led by Otho . <eos> Following this coup , Otho was appointed regent in March 480 , replacing Niger . Otho quickly rose to power , overthrowing Niger and installing Marcus Aurelius Crassus as his successor . Crassus quickly became unpopular with the Roman people , and soon after overthrowing Crassus , he began plotting to overthrow Domitian . Otho tried to persuade his fellow conspirators to join him in this scheme , but these plans were thwarted by Crassus 's own conspirators . In April , Crassus and his men entered Rome , captured Crassus 's wife and murdered her in a plot to assassinate Domitian . <eos> Crassus was assassinated on 23 April 480 , shortly after the beginning of the Second Punic War . The Roman Senate tried to prevent his assassination , but he eventually managed to escape and continue his campaign . In December , Crassus , along with Aurelius Niger , Marcus Aurelius Niger , and Otho , were assassinated by assassins led by Crassus 's former protégé Quintus Custius Sapieni . <eos> <eos> = = Historical background = = <eos> <eos> The Roman Empire was a sprawling empire that stretched from the Peloponnese to the Danube , spanning almost all of modern @-@ day France , the Rhine , the Alps , the Black Forest , the Dardanelles , the Alps , the Black Sea , the Peloponnese , the Dardanelles , the Vandals , the Teutonic Knights , the Franks , the Ostrogoths , the Seljuk Turks , the Bulgarians , the Lombards , the Sarmatians , the Armenians , the Illyrians , the Saxons , the Vandals , the Ostrogoths , the Cumanids , the Huns

in 1888 . While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century . <eos> The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of diesel engines in the 1890s . Several designs were developed for an improved version of the screw propulsion system , including one by Peterson & Co. of Dayton , Ohio , which incorporated a horizontal ironclad ram and diesel engines . A second design , by Clifton & Co. of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , was the first attempt at electric propulsion , but this was abandoned after four years of development . <eos> The United States Navy experimented with multiple ship propulsion schemes during the 1890s . At the time , these designs were not widely used , and American shipbuilders quickly abandoned them . An alternative propulsion system was developed by Woolley & Co. of Philadelphia , which incorporated a horizontal ironclad ram and diesel engines . A third design , by Mather & Co. of Chicago , Illinois , was more successful , but abandoned after eight years of development . <eos> The United States Navy experimented with multiple ship propulsion schemes during the 1900s . At the time , these designs were not widely used , and American shipbuilders quickly abandoned them . A fourth design , by E. H. Snider of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , was the first attempt at electric propulsion , but abandoned after four years of development . <eos> The development of diesel engines during the 1920s has been attributed to lessons learned from the American Civil War , which emphasized a reduction in the use of coal to power machinery . While their use was limited by the need to move materials and boilers , they were also a significant factor in the decision to build battleships . <eos> <eos> = = Overview = = <eos> <eos> The United States Navy 's first electric propulsion system was the Monitor , a steam @-@ powered ship built in 1885 .

spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination . Yet his fascination was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced variants of it obsessively for decades . <eos> Paintings by Campanella are often considered the first true masterpieces of Impressionism , as they share many similarities with Pablo Picasso 's mature works . The technical skill and imaginative imagination of Campanella 's paintings have been compared to those of Hans Christian Andersen , Alexander Pope , Nativity at Nuremberg , The Dream of Gerontius , The Animal Kingdom , and Masterpieces by Hans Christian Andersen . In the late 1960s , Pablo Picasso began to paint more realistic depictions of <unk> , ground @-@ floor apartment buildings , and dice rolls . This trend continued into the 1970s , when he began to incorporate allegorical imagery into his paintings . This culminated in his use of centering on lakes and spires in The Dream of Gerontius , The Animal Kingdom , and Masterpieces by Hans Christian Andersen . <eos> In spite of the similarities between the paintings and Picasso 's work , Pablo Picasso never became a prolific painter . He was , however , highly successful in reproducing many of his works , especially The Dream of Gerontius , which he exhibited at the La Scala in 1962 . This prompted Picasso to create The Feast of the Goat , a painting that is considered to be his masterpiece . In 1975 , he exhibited two other paintings : Picasso 's White Satin Garden , and The Haunted Mask of Mother Teresa . <eos> <eos> = = Interpretation = = <eos> <eos> Interpretation of Pablo Picasso 's work has been the subject of much scholarly debate . Scholars have divided opinion on whether he was a master of painting , or merely a tool in the hands of a master . In an interview with Vogue magazine in 2002 , British art historian Michael Billington stated that Pablo Picasso was " perhaps the most masterful master of his time " , and argued that " even if he had been born into a privileged family , he would have learnt from the experience of painting . " <eos> While acknowledging that Pablo Picasso 's work is often considered inferior to Picasso 's , art historian Michael Billington stated that " there is no doubt that Pablo Picasso was a precocious and creative artist who combined great talent and practical experienc

As with the TSR , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El NiÃ±o @-@ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , which is located in the tropics . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) uses this information to track an estimated average of 10 storms per season , which is significantly higher than the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) , which tracks tropical cyclones at tropical storm strength . <eos> <eos> = = Season summary = = <eos> <eos> During the previous year , the JTWC had only monitored one season , and their first two seasons were inactive . The activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 34 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Although officially , subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total , this figure was partially due to a lack of data on Gloria 's intensity , which made the calculation impossible . <eos> During the season , ten tropical depressions formed , of which five attained tropical storm status . The first storm of the season , Saffir @-@ Simpson , developed on July 1 , and dissipated the next day . Eight of the eleven tropical storms , including Saffir @-@ Simpson , did not strengthen beyond Category 3 intensity , which is Category 4 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale .

Kutuzov highly recommended by the Emperor . He was an experienced tactician and strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military ; he had been Archduke Charles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1799 , and had organised the defence of Vienna from the Austrian army in the early years of the war . <eos> Franz Joseph I soon began to take over command of the Austrian army , deciding that a decisive battle should be fought at Brno in June 1799 . The decision was made on 23 June 1799 , when Joseph II led a massive assault on the city , which ultimately resulted in the defeat of the Austrian army at Brno . This victory paved the way for the subsequent campaign in northern Italy , which saw the fall of Milan and the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars . <eos> <eos> = = Prelude = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = Preliminary moves = = = <eos> <eos> On 23 June 1799 , Joseph II ordered an attack on the Austrian capital , Vienna .

Although it was intended to take place at Brno , a number of Austrian commanders were opposed to this plan , including Archduke Charles , who feared that a simultaneous attack would disrupt the peace negotiations . On 24 June , Joseph II 's army entered the city . <eos> The initial Austrian attack was made by skirmishing between Austrian and French forces , which forced the French to retreat , while the Austrian army pursued the fleeing Austrian soldiers back to Vienna . This resulted in a series of bloody skirmishes between Austrian and French troops in the vicinity of the city . This resulted in the deaths of at least two officers and 150 soldiers .

predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the Nuffield A13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential to have a longer range and compact design , as well as larger armour and armament . <eos> The decision to build the Mark VI was made in October 1943 , with the approval of the War Office . As a result , the Nuffield A13 @-@ class tank was chosen as the main armament choice for the Nuffields . As a result , the General Staff considered that the smaller , more powerful Mark VI could be used in close support of a larger armoured division , and chose the Littorio I class , which was much more heavily armoured and armed with 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns . The decision was made to replace the Littorio I with the Fiat CR.42 biplane tank . <eos> The Nuffield A13 @-@ class tank proved very successful in service , although it was not very successful in the field . As a result , the British Army considered it unsuitable for heavy operations , and therefore decided to replace it with a tank destroyer . As a result , the Nuffields were withdrawn from service in late 1944 . The British destroyers Courageous and Pantelimon were used as destroyers in Operation Ripper in late 1945 . <eos> <eos> = = Development = = <eos> <eos> In late 1943 , the General Staff decided to build a new armoured division to replace the Littorio I class . This was designated the Mark VI , and in the same year , plans were drawn up for a tank destroyer division . The first proposal was submitted in October 1943 , and construction began in December 1944 . At the same time , a number of proposals were made for an armoured cruiser division , including a cruiser @-@ sized design , but these were rejected due to the cost of development . In March 1945 , the General Staff decided to consider another armoured division , but decided against it because of the need to destroy anti @-@ aircraft guns . The decision was made to use a combination of Littorio I and Littorio II , which were both capable of carrying heavy weapons . <eos> In the meantime , a proposal to build a cruiser division was considered , but it was rejected because of the poor performance of the Littorio I class

As the 1st Airborne Division advanced towards the Rock , a small group of men from the 11th Battalion — who had been sent to cover the advance — were killed in the Battle of Sirte .

The remainder of the division remained in Gibraltar until early November , when it was withdrawn to Anzac Cove . <eos> Following the withdrawal of the 1st Airborne Division , the British Army attempted to establish a base at Sidi Rezegh , but were unable to do so due to lack of manpower . As a result , the decision was made to send the remainder of the division to Anzac Cove , where it would be used to support the planned assault on the beachhead . The capture of Sidi Rezegh in late September also meant that the British forces in the area were unable to mount an effective counter @-@ attack . <eos> Following the capture of the beachhead , the 1st Airborne Division began its advance towards the Rock .

In 1155 , John made an agreement with John to allow him to retain the offices of chancellor and general , but when John refused to accept it , John also confiscated the property of the monastery of St. Peter 's Basilica . In 1156 , John abdicated and was replaced by his son Michael III . <eos> John did not immediately assume the title of Caesar , but instead chose to assume the consulship of Emperor Michael II , who immediately began negotiations with John . In 1157 , John made a deal with John that allowed him to retain the offices of chancellor and general , but that he would not be allowed to take them until after John 's death .

Chinese poetic history . <eos> <eos> = = = Moral engagement = = = <eos> <eos> A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( <unk> <unk> ) , who goes on to say that the ultimate goal of Chinese poetry is to express human emotions and thereby aid the reader in understanding the world around them . This principle , however , has been criticized by some critics , who argue that this kind of poetry encourages readers to think through the consequences of their actions . For example , Go @-@ Toba Kun of the New York Times writes that " even though a sage 's poetic output can be read as welcoming and rational , it is often the case that he abandons rationality and leads a life of pleasure and quietness . " <eos> Another popular theme is the importance of ethical considerations in Chinese poetry . The philosophical philosopher Tao Te Ching states that " even though one understands an individual 's feelings and motivations through thoughts , emotions , and actions , it is impossible to know how to express those feelings , motivations , and actions without thinking through them . " This idea is further elaborated by the poet Guan Yu , who argues that , even though one understands an individual 's feelings and motivations through thoughts , emotions , and actions , it is impossible to know how to express those feelings , motivations , and actions without thinking through them . <eos> The Chinese philosopher Lu <unk> also emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in Chinese poetry . He writes that , even though one understands an individual 's feelings and motivations through thoughts , emotions , and actions , it is impossible to know how to express those feelings , motivations , and actions without thinking through them . <eos> <eos> = = = Britain = = = <eos> <eos> The British poet Sir William Wordsworth was a major influence on the development of Chinese poetry .

This poem is also the first in which a Chinese poet addresses the reader directly , through a discussion of his own feelings and motivations . <eos> The British philosopher John Keats was also a major influence on Chinese poetry .

light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and the Tetrarch was considered to be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service ; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Pacific theater were scrapped or transferred to Japan in 1942 . <eos> <eos> = = Development = = <eos> <eos> The development of the tank began in 1920 , when Leslie M. Sharp , a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California , Berkeley , was commissioned to design a new type of heavy tank . This new tank would have been armed with the same main armament as the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C Wildcat , but with improved armor protection and armament . This design was approved by the Bureau of Ordnance in 1922 , and given the name " Thin Tank " . The basic concept was that a heavy tank with the same armament as the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C Wildcat would be able to penetrate heavy armor and cause serious damage to targets , with the ability to destroy them outright . Although it was not known at the time that the F @-@ 111C would be used , Sharp 's report prompted an investigation by the Army Ordnance Department . <eos> Sharp submitted his report to the Bureau of Ordnance on July 1 , 1922 , and submitted it to the War Department on August 21 , 1922 . The Bureau of Ordnance did not immediately begin design studies of the new tank , but soon after received it from the War Department . By December 1922 , the Bureau of Ordnance had decided to begin construction of the heavy tank , and on January 3 , 1923 , Sharp submitted a draft design for the new tank . This design was approved by the War Department on February 11 , 1923 , and given the name " Thin Tank " .

The first known rock exposures were made in 1981 by Russell Barkley and colleagues , who found that several basaltic lava flows flowed from the volcano . Much of the material they found was deposited by impacts from streamflow vents , as well as slow flows and lahars . Much of the volcanic material was recovered from an impact crater , with two exceptions . One was located near the north end of the Pangaea Formation , while the other was near the south end of the Pangaea Formation . The basaltic lavas were formed by slow flows that traveled along faults in the volcanic field . As a result , the two basaltic flows probably formed at different times , with the first flow occurring between 1983 and 1989 . <eos> A crater with a diameter of about 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) was discovered in 1987 by Guy Everhart and colleagues . The first rock exposures were made in 1991 by Leonard Cubitt and colleagues , who found that several small craters had been active during the Late Cretaceous Period . Although several lava flows flowed from the volcano , none were found in a rock pool near the north end of the Pangaea Formation . This rock pool was later identified as the source of the flow A1 .

, Tacitus speaks highly of Nerva , describing his reign as " the dawn of a most happy age , [ when ] Nerva Caesar blended things once irreconcilable , sovereignty and freedom " . <eos> The surviving histories speak equally of Nerva 's achievements , with major historical figures such as Piero Caragiale ( c . 1275 – 1328 ) and Octavian ( c . 1328 – 1341 ) being particularly influential . While the latter was at sea , he adopted a policy of neutrality towards the Roman Empire , even though it cost him much of his fortune . Tacitus records that he went to Venice in 1279 to seek advice from Pope Innocent III , who advised him to avoid engaging in politics and abstain from engaging in public speaking . <eos> Despite his successes , Nerva 's reign was not a happy one . The Empire was disintegrating under the influence of a series of civil wars and civil wars between the two powers . This , in turn , contributed to the collapse of the Empire 's political system . In 1328 , Emperor John VI Laertes ( r . 1321 – 1341 ) made peace with the Lombards , ending the civil war and reunifying the Empire under a new constitution . <eos> The last emperor , Frederick II ( r . 1353 – 1385 ) , was assassinated in 1357 . Emperor John VI did not attend the funeral , but instead stayed at the imperial court in Munich . After his death , his widow Sophia ( d . 1385 ) assumed the title of Augusta Augusta . <eos> <eos> = = Explanatory notes = = <eos> <eos> <eos> <eos> = The Boat Race 1858 = <eos> <eos> The 158th Boat Race took place on 3 April 1858 .

Owen comments on the contrast between the pompous pomp of Beaumaris and the serene serenity of Saltire , writing that " their common features are a kind of mellow serenity " , while Grainger sees Beaumaris as " a fine example of an early English landscape " . <eos> Beaumaris 's style was influenced by the Italian renaissance , which brought together regional styles and gave rise to a variety of landscapes , including Harlequin or country houses . He combined Italianate , Romanesque and Gothic forms with Perpendicular forms , giving Beaumaris a uniquely English landscape . His major works include the triptychs The Crystal Palace and the Corinthian Temple , the Nude Garden , the Altar of Thorns , the Altar of Granby , the Three Sisters , the White Madonna , and the Four Gables . <eos> Beaumaris 's major landscapes are set in rural areas , often depicting pastimes such as country houses , gardens , misty countryside , or colonnades .

as the IJN wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo detonations .

The primary reason for the delays was the need to increase the speed of the ships to allow them to pass through the minefields laid by the German High Seas Fleet during the Battle of Jutland . Three designs were submitted by the OKB for a twin @-@ gun design : one for a light cruiser , one for a battleship , and one for a heavy cruiser . The first was accepted on 30 June 1918 , and the second on 1 August . Both designs were built by NEBB , NEBB Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino ( STT ) , Trieste Shipbuilding & Engineering Company , Trieste . The contract for the first design was awarded to N.

The navies of Great Britain and France built and operated a number of coastal batteries , including Fort William Henry , built in 1859 . As early as 1864 , British naval historian William James described the fortifications as " virtually useless " , because they were too small to defend the coastline , and their effectiveness was limited by the fact that they were constructed with reinforced concrete . <eos> As early as 1866 , it was reported that a French warship , Jean Bart , had been spotted by a zeppelin flying from Ravenna , Malta , on 23 August 1866 . The ship had observed the zeppelin flying at low altitude , and after taking off from Ravenna , Bart made his way to the entrance of the harbour . There , he found a number of men who had joined the ship , including its captain , Captain William F. Wood , who had been wounded in the attack . He then proceeded to give chase , but was chased down by the zeppelin , which also fired two torpedoes . Bart eventually escaped , and fought off a number of other ships before returning to Ravenna . <eos> By 1869 , a French warship , Jean Bart , had been spotted by a zeppelin flying from Malta , and after taking off from Ravenna , Bart made his way to the entrance of the harbour .

the animal <unk> in 1837 . In 1841 , English palaeontologist Richard Owen referred to the genus as Labyrinthodon to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth . Owen thought the name Mastodonsaurus " ought not to be confused with the modern crocodile " , but instead it was used for the type specimen of Mastodonsaurus sarcophagus , which is known from more than a dozen specimens collected from Permian to Neogene times . The generic name " Labyrinthodon " is derived from the Ancient Greek words <unk> ( " opposite " ) and σαυρος ( " lizard " ) , referring to the shape of the animal 's skull . The specific name sarcophagus is Latin for " perineum " , referring to the gap between the eyes . The binomial name " Labyrinthodon " , which has been used for species previously described as dubious , was coined by mycologist George Bentham in his 1871 work Mammal Species of the World . <eos> The generic name sarcophagus refers to the fact that the animal had a thick horny covering of scales on its back , and this covering is known as the " spine " of the animal . This spine is especially prominent in juvenile animals , where it extends over the entire length of the animal . This arrangement of scales allows for flexibility in sclerotia , allowing for complex interactions between different species . The animal 's eyes are relatively large , with relatively few pupil rows , and its mouth is relatively narrow . This makes it difficult to see with the naked eye , which requires a magnifying glass . The animal 's neck is relatively short , being between 35 and 40 centimetres ( 14 and 16 in ) long . The first dorsal fin is relatively large , about 3 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) long , and the second dorsal fin is much smaller , at 1 @.@ 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) long . The caudal fin is relatively short , at only 3 @.@ 3 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 1 in ) long , and the snout is relatively broad . The hump is relatively short , at only 4 @.@ 3 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) long , and the legs are relatively short .

An important aspect of this approach is that it avoids the need for an accurate and easily reproducible estimate of the size of the eye , as well as the need to compute the frequency of light emitted by the human eye , which can be done by direct measurement of the size of the eye . <eos> <eos> = = Experimental evidence = = <eos> <eos> The use of visual acuity measurements has been used to determine the accuracy of " supersonic flight " experiments , which use a wide range of instruments and data , including infrared , ultraviolet , gamma ray , X @-@ ray , gamma ray bursts , interferometric measurements , magnetic fields , magnetic fields , and particle accelerators . In particular , experiments using pulsed X @-@ rays have been shown to be accurate . <eos> A study published in 2010 by the University of California , Berkeley showed that measurements of " supersonic flight " were not statistically significant , but rather inconclusive . The researchers used a sample of 25 subjects and concluded that their subjects ' estimates of the speed of light from the eye were significantly higher than those from the ground . This was consistent with the results of previous experiments , which had shown that measurement of the speed of light from the eye could be used to determine the accuracy of a given measurement . <eos> In 2011 , a study published in Nature by Cooper et al. found that although an experiment using pulsed X @-@ rays was statistically significant , it did not demonstrate that an accurate measurement of the speed of light from the eye could be made .

press into notoriety , and brought Bacon 's work to national attention . Peppiatt notes that the exhibition showed Bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact , and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , such as pranks . Peppiatt argues that this point of view , which Peppiatt calls " an early example of a subversive subversive subversive movement " , was at odds with Bacon 's intent , which was to demonstrate that the goal of a subversive movement was to destroy what was perceived as an oppressive system of government . Peppiatt suggests that this lack of public interest may have been a factor in the decision to exclude Bacon from the exhibition . <eos> Peppiatt argues that the purpose of the work was to demonstrate that the concept of " rational evil " had become more widespread in the United States than it had been in Britain .

The first part of the story was written by his friend , writer and director David Calderwood , who had previously worked on the detective series Ace Ventura : Unearthed Arcadia . In preparation for the role , Calderwood read several books on the subject , including those by Richard Wagner , Heinrich Himmler , Rudolf Hess , Heinrich Müller , Heinrich Hoffmann , Rudolf Hess , Rudolf Hess 's writings , and M. W.

A Royal Armoured Corps report in 1961 noted that although Soviet tank numbers were not significantly higher than Soviet ones , Soviet tank commanders made a number of attempts to increase Soviet tank numbers , but none were successful . <eos> Soviet tank commanders made similar attempts to improve Soviet tank effectiveness . In February 1942 , General Mikhail Gorbachev ordered the construction of five new armored divisions . The first was the 21st Tank Division , which became the first Soviet tank division to be equipped with the M1A1 Abrams tank gun . In March 1942 , Soviet tank commanders began to deploy their tank forces into " cross country " operations , where they would attempt to destroy Allied convoys and support ground forces in Malaya . In June 1942 , Soviet tank commanders began to deploy their tank forces into Afghanistan , where they would attempt to capture American forces , but were unsuccessful . <eos> Soviet tank commanders also attempted to increase Soviet tank effectiveness by creating a new generation of specialized vehicles . In the late 1940s , Soviet tank commanders began to use armored personnel carriers ( APCs ) , which were designed to carry heavy equipment , and specialized fire control systems . These new vehicles also became known as " cradle tanks " . <eos> <eos> = = Operational history = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = Soviet tank doctrine = = = <eos> <eos> The first armored division was created in 1941 , when the OKM started to develop a new tank concept .

At least one interpretation suggests that the inhabitants of Mexico acquired knowledge of both the languages and customs of the region through oral traditions , while another suggests that the inhabitants of Mexico acquired knowledge of both the indigenous languages and customs of the region through literary references . The cultural influence of the conquest on Mexican culture is also unclear . <eos> The notion that the inhabitants of Mexico acquired knowledge of the indigenous languages and customs is a myth has been challenged by scholars . At least one theory suggests that the indigenous languages and customs were acquired through oral traditions , while another suggests that the indigenous languages and customs were acquired through literary references .

Because of its size , the impact zone covers a relatively small area , and there are no indications that it is permanently inhabited . A possible explanation for this is that the region was created by the collision of comets and asteroids , which then drifted apart to form the polar regions of the ice giants . <eos> The origin of the impact zone is not known , but it may be connected to the large moon Io , which was discovered in 1975 . This moon orbits in the same direction as the impact zone , though the exact location of the moon 's orbit remains unknown . It is thought that the impact zone may have been created by a collision between comets and asteroids , or possibly by the moon itself . <eos> <eos> = = Name = = <eos> <eos> The name " Shackleton " is derived from the Ancient Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " pillar " , and <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " keel " .

The cost to rebuild Rome was immense , requiring funds the state treasury did not have . Nero devalued the Roman currency for the first time in the Empire 's history . He reduced the weight of the denarius from 84 per Roman pound to 96 ( equivalent to about £ 1 @,@ 000 in today 's terms ) , and imposed a new law that prohibited marks on metal coins . The result was a massive increase in the coinage of silver , which at first was only lightly used , but eventually became widely accepted . <eos> Despite this , Rome 's economy remained weak , with debts reaching an all @-@ time high of over 80 per cent of the national debt in AD 43 . The Romans were unable to pay their debts adequately , and it was only after a series of crises in the early Republic that the government could pay off the debts . Under Nero , the economy recovered , but Rome 's standing suffered as a result of the fall of Rome to the Empire . <eos> The death of Julius Caesar in AD 43 left a vacuum that filled the vacuum , which eventually led to the collapse of the Roman Republic . Although the political system was restored , the senate allowed several senators to be elected , and this ultimately led to the civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors . In AD 44 , a coalition of senators led by Marcus Licinius Crassus successfully overthrew Crassus 's government , which then became known as the Republic . <eos> <eos> = = Etymology = = <eos> <eos> The name Rome derives from the Latin word <unk> , meaning " enclosure " , and <unk> , meaning " band " .

The Americans defeated the First Philippine Republic and captured president Emilio Aguinaldo who announced allegiance to the United States on April 1 , 1901 . <eos> Upon drafting a new charter for Manila in June 1901 , the Americans made official what had long been a popular theme of the Philippines : the principle of national unity . The Philippines was , however , divided between Filipinos who had adopted republicanism and those who had fought for independence . Thus , when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Philippine Constitution on December 11 , 1901 , he proclaimed the independence of the Philippines . This declaration prompted some Filipinos to believe that the United States was planning to annex the Philippines , but this view was not universally accepted . <eos> When the American Revolution broke out in April 1903 , Filipinos in the north and west of the country were divided between pro @-@ independence Filipinos and those who had fought for independence . The American government tried to persuade the Filipinos to join the fight against the United States , but they refused . Angered by this refusal , the Americans began a series of military campaigns against the Filipinos . A major battle took place in May 1903 when the Americans captured Makiling and Barangay Peninsula , respectively . <eos> Filipinos who had fought for independence in the Philippines fought alongside the Americans in several battles , including the Battle of Umag and the Battle of Poiman .

The modern pronunciation of the name is <unk> ( <unk> ) . <eos> The present @-@ day village of <unk> is located on the banks of the Ombla River . <eos> <eos> = = Hydrology = = <eos> <eos> The water table at the mouth of the Ombla River is generally considered to be of low quality . From 1925 to 1939 , the average discharge was between 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 cubic metres per second ( 52 and 59 cu ft / s ) . However , from 1972 to 1975 , the average discharge was between 700 and 1 @,@ 300 cubic metres per second ( 37 and 41 cu ft / s ) . The discharge in 1991 was estimated at between 600 and 900 cubic metres per second ( 18 and 24 cu ft / s ) . The river 's low pH makes it unsuitable for irrigation , since the chlorinated water in the river has a higher concentration of phosphorus than that in the rest of the world . <eos> The main source of pollution in the Ombla River is rainwater , which comes from the Marojejy area of northeastern Madagascar . Because of its proximity to the Marojejy River , the river receives about 10 @,@ 000 tonnes of phosphorus per year , which is concentrated in the form of rainwater from the Marojejy River .

When they investigate , they discover that a man named Dean O 'Dell ( James Spader ) is also involved . When they learn that O 'Dell was at the college , they realize that he did not know who he was . <eos> The episode guest stars Dan Castellaneta as Detective Bud Weiss , who acts as a detective for the police . This was Castellaneta 's first appearance on Veronica Mars . When asked about his character , Castellaneta said that he enjoyed playing a detective , and enjoyed working with Lance Henriksen . When asked about the idea of having Veronica be kidnapped by O 'Dell , Castellaneta said that he had been thinking about that since he first read the script for the episode .

<unk> , was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern Philippines in late October 2013 . Forming on October 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward . <unk> developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking northern Luzon on October 29 . The typhoon weakened over land , dissipating the next day . There were no deaths or injuries associated with Dolly . <eos> <eos> = = Meteorological history = = <eos> <eos> Typhoon Dolly originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 6 . Tracking westward , the system gradually organized . On October 9 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 07W at 1200 UTC . At this time , the depression was located about 1 @,@ 200 km ( 750 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Pohnpei , Taiwan . The depression tracked generally westward due to a ridge to its north . Convection increased near the center , and the JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Dolly at 0600 UTC on October 10 . Initially , the storm was forecast to strengthen further to typhoon status , but due to interaction with a nearby subtropical ridge , Dolly quickly became disorganized . At 0600 UTC on October 11 , the JMA upgraded Dolly to a severe tropical storm , and the JTWC followed suit at 1200 UTC on October 12 . <eos> Initially , Dolly was expected to continue westward due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge , but due to land interaction , the storm moved quickly northward . At 0600 UTC on October 13 , the JMA upgraded Dolly to typhoon status , and the JTWC followed suit at 0600 UTC on October 14 . At the same time , the JMA estimated that Dolly attained peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . At the same time , the JMA estimated that Dolly attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 4 on the SSHWS .

The meeting concluded with Bush proposing a proposal for a new ironclad warship , which was approved by the Senate on September 11 , 1914 . <eos> In his report to the Senate , Bush wrote that " [ t ] he [ Royal Navy ] has not yet begun to acquire any more guns , but will soon be able to use them as soon as they are ready to be used . " He also suggested that a third class of battleships would be needed , which was approved on October 1 , 1914 . The Navy 's Bureau of Ordnance ( BuOrd ) estimated that a new ironclad warship would cost $ 160 million to build , and the President authorized $ 160 million for this purpose . Bush then wrote to Nimitz that " I am confident that this is a satisfactory result of the proposed design , but I do not believe that it will be satisfactory to the Secretary of the Navy who , having regard for the performance of the vessel , will take no action to recommend to the Board that the new ironclad b

a reference to the wide , flat heads of <unk> and other early tetrapods . During this time , palaeontologists considered <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile skeletons , relatively long hind limbs , and the presence of a row of digits on the dorsal side of the tail . Early palaeontologists also thought that <unk> were similar to crocodylomorphs , but later research has shown that these two traits were not shared by all tetrapods . This view was challenged by Ostrom 's discovery of an early fossilized proboscis ( wrist @-@ like structure ) in <unk> , which lacked the digits on the dorsal side of the tail . Later studies have shown that this was a primitive tetrapod , and that this could be the same as the proboscis found in crocodilians . The lack of digits on the dorsal side of the tail has been interpreted as evidence that crocodilians were bipedal . <eos> Later studies have shown that crocodilians possessed quadrupedalism , as well as some forms of walking . A study in 2005 found that some species of tetrapod had limbs with three digits on the dorsal side of the tail , but this was not enough to rule out quadrupedality .

Imagists rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast , Imagism called for a return to what were considered " lost " Romanticism , while Dostoyevsky 's works tended to be more direct and grandiose . Imagism , like Dostoyevsky , was influenced by the works of Petrarch , Chaucer , Homer , Homer , Homerándas , Petrarch 's contemporaries , and Erasmus . <eos> Dostoyevsky often used long sentences , often punctuated by an abrupt pause , to convey a feeling of sadness or pleasure . He often wrote about the loss of his beloved , the narrator , with lines such as " I have lost my soul / Who can tell me how to live ? " and " How can I make myself feel ? " , which are often interpreted as metaphors for the feelings he felt when he was alone . In many of his poems , Dostoyevsky never speaks of his feelings , but rather expresses them through metaphors . For example , in " The Nightingale " , he describes the impossibility of living in a dream : " My soul is gone , / I am gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / My dream gone , / M

to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 , Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu . The next day , the JMA downgraded Kujira to a tropical storm . <eos> While moving through the Philippines , Kujira produced torrential rainfall that caused flooding and landslides in Taiwan . An estimated 20 @,@ 000 people were left without power in Taipei , affecting roughly 1 @,@ 300 km2 ( 625 sq mi ) of crops . Flooding also affected other parts of Taiwan , including Panggilan , where more than 20 bridges were washed out .

The system developed into a tropical depression on April 6 , and subsequently became Tropical Storm Kujira the next day . With favorable conditions , the storm moved generally westward and gradually intensified . Early on April 7 , the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm , while the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also monitored the system . <eos> Initially , the storm was forecast to strengthen into a typhoon , but due to interaction with land , the JTWC discontinued advisories on the storm at 0600 UTC on April 8 . The next day , the JMA estimated that Kujira attained peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Around that time , the JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon , and at 1200 UTC on April 9 , the JTWC estimated that Kujira attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . At the same time , the JMA estimated that the storm attained its minimum barometric pressure of 994 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . <eos> Tracking westward , Kujira began to weaken as i
October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) in Ilan County . A few days later , the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 16W , which was centered about 230 km ( 145 mi ) south of Yap . The depression tracked generally westward and gradually intensified , becoming a tropical storm on September 6 . That day , the JMA upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) . That day , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , making it a super typhoon .

Regardless , Gazan 's division was nearly destroyed ; the French lost around 1 @,@ 500 men , and as a result Gazan 's artillery inflicted heavy casualties on the British . The capture of Gazan 's division also marked the beginning of the Battle of Ploiești , which lasted until 29 August . <eos> The initial French attacks were repulsed by a combination of small @-@ scale artillery fire and coordinated attacks by Austrian infantry . Despite this , the British continued to hold on to the city , aided by diversionary attacks by some French units . Despite these successes , the British continued to suffer casualties from repeated artillery fire , particularly during the Battle of Romani . The failure of the French to capture the city prompted Dupont to order a withdrawal from Toulon , which was completed in the early hours of 30 August . <eos> <eos> = = Background = = <eos> <eos> Following the French defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , which took place on 11 June 1815 , an army under Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated at the Battle of Basel . The defeat weakened the French position in Europe , and only after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 did France regain control of most of northern Europe . In 1871 , Napoleon Bonaparte launched a major offensive in northern France , pushing the French back across the Pyrenees . The ensuing Battle of Toulon was a decisive victory for the French , as it ended the Seven Years ' War . <eos> In 1871 , Napoleon Bonaparte led a large army into Germany , where he defeated the Austrian forces at the Battle of Stockach . In the aftermath of the battle , the Austrian government attempted to negotiate a peace with Austria , but it was not until after the Franco @-@ Prussian War that Austria officially recognized the right of the French to govern and train its own army .

Under the terms of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , the Ottomans gained control of northwestern Italy and Dacia , respectively . In 1501 , Pope Innocent III declared that the Holy Roman Empire was a " new and glorious kingdom " . The same year , Pope Honorius III also authorized the construction of a fort at Ilium , which would be used to defend the city against external enemies . <eos> The Venetians invaded Italy in 1511 , starting the First Italian War of Independence . Although Venice and the Empire were not directly involved in the conflict , they brought up an armed rebellion against the Venetians in 1513 . Despite initial successes , the revolt was crushed by the Knights Templar in 1515 . The city fell to the Venetians in 1518 , and they occupied it until 1603 . In 1621 , a French army under Jean @-@ Baptiste Jourdan advanced into Italy , taking Milan and threatening to turn the country into a French protectorate . In 1625 , a series of military conflicts between the two powers culminated in the Thirty Years ' War , which lasted until the end of the war . <eos> In 1628 , during the French occupation of Milan , some Italian cities were annexed by the Kingdom of Naples . The city was again the scene of fighting between the Knights Templar and the Venetians , but these conflicts ended with the Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1629 . In 1632 , a military expedition led by Count Pierre de Balzac captured Florence and Vittoria , forcing the city to surrender . This led to the Second Italian War of Independence , which lasted from 1638 to 1642 . The war was won by the Knights Templar , who used the pretext of restoring the Venetian Empire . <eos> The Italian Peninsula remained under French control until the end of the 18th century . During the Napoleonic Wars , the city fell to the Allies , who were defeated in the Battle of Otranto in 1799 . During th
, reconstruction took place . <eos> In 1948 , President Elpidio Quirino moved the seat of government of the Philippines to Quezon City , a new capital city in the suburbs and fields northeast of Manila , created in 1938 by former mayor Ferdinand Marcos . The old capital was renamed Pampanga in 1949 , after the Battle of Pampanga . This brought the old capital back under the control of the Philippine Nationalist Party ( PNP ) . This brought a period of political instability , as the United States intervened in the conflict and started the American @-@ led occupation of the Philippines . The communist government of Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown in a military coup d 'état on 1 April 1954 , which deposed Marcos and installed his son @-@ in @-@ law , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva . <eos> In a bid to restore stability , the United States provided US $ 25 million ( $ 263 million in 2015 dollars ) to the Philippines in 1955 , the first such money to be used for this purpose . The State Department of the Philippines provided US $ 25 million ( $ 230 million in 2015 dollars ) to rebuild the city , which was completed in 1956 . This made the Philippines the largest city in the world to be rebuilt after World War II . <eos> Following the restoration of the old capital , Marcos took office as President of the Philippines in 1959 . He reorganized the Philippine Nationalist Party ( PNP ) , which had been a part of the Nationalist Party since 1891 , and renamed it the Philippine Democratic Party ( PKP ) . The party used the name Pampanga as its capital , while other political parties continued to use the city as their headquarters . In 1964 , the United States began the withdrawal of American troops from the Philippines , ending Philippine independence . <eos> In 1970 , the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) began negotiations with the United States to establish a military base in the Philippines .

to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester 's relationship had reached . Spacey and Bening worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost seduces Carolyn was based on a conversation between Bening and one of his friends , who were watching a movie at the time . <eos> Spacey wanted to have the characters " fall in love " with each other , but found it difficult to do so because of the amount of time they spent together . He also thought that it would be difficult to tell if Lester and Carolyn were " really together " or if they were " just the same person " . Bening described the relationship as " interesting " because he felt that it was something that people would want to see more of , but not necessarily relate to . He explained that " if you were a kid , you would always be thinking about how much of a good thing it would be " . Bening also thought that the characters would remain close friends , and suggested that they become " totally immersed in each other 's life " . <eos> Spacey originally intended to have Lester , Carolyn and Bening kiss at the end of the episode , but changed his mind after realizing that it would be too dark . Bening explained that " it was always going to be the same story " , and " I think it 's always going to be the same character " . Bening also thought that Lester and Carolyn would remain friends , and suggested that they become " totally immersed in each other 's life " . <eos> Bening described the relationship between Lester and Carolyn as " a little more serious " than that between Bening and Amy Poehler , but felt that it was not necessarily one of them . He explained that " Amy and Lester are two different people " , and that " they 're both kind of independent and happy " . Bening also thought that the two characters would remain close friends , and suggested that they become " totally immersed in each other 's life " . <eos> Bening described the scene in which Lester proposes to Amy that he is going to propose to her , as " a very touching moment " . He explained that he had wanted to do it because he felt that it was " kind of cool " , and that it was " kind of touching " .

dominance . As a competitor , Nero raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer . Though Nero faltered in his racing ( in one case , dropping out of the race ) , he was praised for his skill as a horseman and horse trainer . <eos> The official history of the Iberian horse shows that Nero competed in chariot racing , chariot driving , chariot assembly , and even combined driving and chariot wrestling . However , historians have also noted that he did not compete in any other types of chariot racing . His chariot racing career was short @-@ lived , as he only competed in chariot assembly , which is where he first competed . In the late 17th century , Nero competed in chariot racing at the Imperial Games in Rome . He did not win any races , but was able to train horses , and went on to become a successful trainer . <eos> <eos> = = Name = = <eos> <eos> The name of Nero 's chariot racing career is unknown , but it was probably Nero who first used the term " chariot " in the late 17th century . This is because the Roman Empire did not have a formal chariot racing tradition , and chariot racing was the only type of chariot racing that existed at the time . The Romans did not have a formal training program for chariot drivers , and chariot drivers were usually hired by the emperor Claudius . Claudius made Claudius his personal trainer , and Claudius trained him as a professional horseman . <eos> Claudius 's training methods and knowledge of chariot racing may have been useful in making him the first horseman to train a professional horseman . In a letter written to Nero , Claudius mentioned that he had trained at the Imperial Games , and Claudius also stated that he had " much experience of driving and chariot assembly " . The emperor and Claudius did not appear to have known each other well , and it is likely that Claudius was familiar with Claudius 's training methods . <eos> The name " Nero " is derived from the Latin word <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " horse " . This is also a reference to the legendary legend that Nero rode a chariot with the reins pulled up by the rider 's reins . This may have been Nero 's nickname for his horse , which is derived from th

The World Bank bought most of the land on which the new building was built , while the Philippine National Bank acquired 25 percent of the city 's assets . Negri also oversaw the construction of the Sibuyan International Airport , which opened in 1937 . <eos> During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines , the central government expanded the number of shops , government offices , and even schools . The central government 's patronage system was strengthened by the establishment of the Philippine Academy of Arts and Sciences , which went on to become the first public high school in the Philippines .

The binary search algorithm , developed by Aryeh Oron and Ilya Ehrensvärd , was first introduced in 1966 by Guido van de Kamp , who later became a pioneer of the use of binary search . <eos> The binary search algorithm was inspired by the theoretical work of Augustin Ehrensvärd and Ilya Ehrensvärd , who had investigated the properties of quaternions in holomorphic geometry . Using these results , they found that there are two ways to solve a problem : first , they can either start with a sequence of integers ( called a " rank " ) or else , they can start with any integer n such that n is an integer greater than the number of rank , and that each rank corresponds to one rank . <eos> The binary search algorithm was developed by Aryeh Oron and Ilya Ehrensvärd in 1966 , following on from their work on string analysis . Using this method , they found that there are two ways to solve a problem : first , they can start with a sequence of integers ( called a " v " ) or else , they can start with any integer n such that
. Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and thus most of the forces attacking Taegu were already there . <eos> The initial attack on Taegu was preceded by a series of coordinated attacks by the NK 6th Division on 19 – 20 July , which succeeded in pushing the North Koreans back across the Naktong River . Although the US 1st Cavalry Division successfully repelled these attacks , the North Koreans still managed to breach the perimeter and push the US troops back across the river . In a coordinated attack on 21 July , the NK 6th Division successfully destroyed the US 24th Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Masan . The next day , the North Korean attack on Taegu was repulsed with heavy casualties , and the US 24th Infantry Regiment and US 1st Cavalry Division were able to break through the UN lines and push the North Koreans back across the Naktong River . <eos> In August , the NK 6th Division attempted to retake the high ground overlooking Taegu . The US 24th Infantry Regiment and the US 1st Cavalry Division , which had been ordered to attack north from Pyongtaek , were unable to do so due to terrain blocking them . With the US 1st Cavalry Division unable to move forward and the North Koreans still not able to break through the UN lines , the US 24th Infantry Regiment was ordered to withdraw from the city . The next day , a large North Korean force under the command of Major General Walton Walker 's NK 13th Division assaulted Taegu . Although the US troops were able to break through the North Korean lines , Walker 's troops held out until 19 August when the US 1st Cavalry Division was withdrawn from the city . <eos> <eos> = = Background = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = Outbreak of war = = = <eos> <eos> Following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 August 1950 , the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 181 on 17 August to punish the North Korean government of the ROK Central Government for the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) .

The United States military had been steadily decreasing the size of its forces since the end of World War II , and there was little fighting along the perimeter to keep it from collapsing . At the same time , the closest major city to the Pusan Perimeter was Masan , which was effectively a secondary supply point for the North Korean People 's Army . <eos> On August 25 , 1950 , Lieutenant General Walton Walker , the commander of the FEAF , ordered Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , commander of the Sixth United States Army , to conduct an operation to capture Masan . The corps planned to do this by moving up the Walled City line and down the western side of the city , then down the road to the Naktong River .

naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view that ramming was the only way to sink an ironclad during the war can be seen in contemporary naval accounts . <eos> Despite these limitations , while threats from British warships continued to mount against the ironclads , none of the major European navies attempted to engage the larger , more powerful armored cruisers of the time . The only significant naval action of the war was the Battle of Copenhagen in 1794 , when the French Navy successfully lured out the powerful armored cruisers Île de France and Ramillies . In 1801 , the British lost a major battle with the French Navy in the Caribbean Sea , when Ramillies and several other ships were sunk by American cruisers . <eos> The advent of gunboats increased the number of warship @-@ based navies in the late 19th century .

At the time , giant freshwater lakes were abundant , so giant freshwater rivers may have formed as ponds and rivers , but a few years later , giant freshwater lakes became more abundant . <eos> The earliest known giant freshwater salamander fossils are found in rocks dated to the Cretaceous o
led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use of polar @-@ orbiting satellite imaging . <eos> The magnitude of an orbiting satellite 's gravitational field is determined by its distance from the Earth , and by the relative velocities of its orbit . Near @-@ Earth objects are also affected by the gravitational field of their host star , in particular by the amount of light it receives from the Sun . Near @-@ Earth objects with a low orbital eccentricity ( ecliptic ) and orbital periods that overlap with those of near @-@ Earth objects , such as red dwarfs , can be affected by the gravitational field of their host star . <eos> A common method for measuring the magnitude of a satellite 's gravitational field is to use a high @-@ resolution spectrometer to measure its surface brightness . This technique , known as Doppler spectroscopy , uses interferometry to determine the spectral line between the spectra of the satellite and the background light . This technique was developed by Alvarez et al. in 1996 , using the Advanced Technology Telescope for Multi @-@ Object Spectrometry ( <unk> ) . This technique uses the EO2 spectrometer to measure the spectral line between the spectra of the satellite and the background light . This technique was developed by Alvarez et al. in 1996 using the HARPS instrument , which uses a wide bandpass filter to determine the band @-@ pass and redshift of individual stars . The HARPS instruments are capable of detecting spectral lines between individual stars at wavelengths between 0 @.@ 5 and 10 μm . <eos> In 2009 , a team at the Harvard @-@ Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced that they had developed a new method for measuring the magnitude of HD 209458 b , which is currently the most accurate method for determining the mass of a satellite . The team used a photometer to measure the redshifts of HD 209458 c , which was the first such method to be developed .

Although the Geelong games had attracted crowds of no more than 500 , the moved game attracted a large crowd and " bolted " the stadium . The reason for the abandonment of the game was that the wooden seats were too small for the spectators , and the decision was made to move the ball away from the field .

The production deliberately minimized the use of red curtains to create a more natural look for the audience , and George Lucas himself did not like the idea of putting giant robots on stage .

praised for an aversion to battle . Like many emperors , Nero faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire . <eos> British Revolt of 60 â 61 ( Boudica 's Uprising ) , in which thousands of rebels were killed , was also suppressed by Nero . The Emperor nevertheless allowed a truce between the two powers in 63 AD , in which a large number of Roman citizens were exiled to Gospatricum . There , they were allowed to return to Rome and continue their revolt . In 66 AD , a new civil war broke out between Emperor Claudius and his son Vespasian . Claudius 's forces , led by Gaius Claudius Petro , quickly defeated the rebels , but their leaders were killed by Nero . <eos> Finally , in 68 AD , Nero ordered the execution of an entire group of Roman citizens who had been imprisoned for treason . The Emperor himself was accused of this crime , and in a series of trials Nero was convicted of all charges . After his death , Nero , along with the other conspirators , were exiled to a prison near Ravenna . There , they were allowed to live in the Villa Marchella , where they lived for several years . <eos> <eos> = = = Internal politics = = = <eos> <eos> The reign of Nero was marked by internal conflicts between the emperor and his subjects . At first , he relied on the support of Rome 's nobility , but by the end of the century , he had become more interested in external affairs . This culminated in the Battle of Actium ( 68 AD ) , in which the emperor defeated the forces of Claudius Petro and took refuge in Rome . Nero , however , was not content to rely on the support of Rome 's people , and turned against them in 68 AD . He made peace with the Romans in 69 AD , by which time he had become convinced that Rome was no longer a threat to Rome 's stability . <eos> In 70 AD , Nero again attempted to take advantage of the situation by invading the Empire . This time , he defeated Claudius Petro in a series of battles , but was defeated decisively by Nero himself . In 71 AD , Nero again attempted to invade Rome , but was defeated decisively by Claudius Petro . In 72 AD , Nero again attempted to take advantage of the situation by invading Rome , but was defeated decisively by Claudius Petro . In 73 AD , Nero again attempted to invade Rom

male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus . This has led to two recent works proposing that Strobilurus was a hybrid between Strobilurus and Araucus , although both have been rejected by some authors . <eos> The closest relatives of Strobilurus are the Acanthorhynchus , whose closest relatives are the related Hemiptera . Although Acanthorhynchus and Strobilurus share many similarities , they differ in the number of flowers they share , the structure of their bodies , and the degree to which they resemble each other . They share a number of characteristics with Acanthorhynchus , including the presence of accessory glandular structures on the head , thorax , and caudal fin bases , which are characteristic of an Acanthorhynchus . The similarity of the two genera has led to some authors considering Strobilurus to be a sister taxon to Strobilurus , while others have argued that Strobilurus is more closely related to Strobilurus than to Acanthorhynchus . <eos> <eos> = = Description = = <eos> <eos> The body of Strobilurus is generally convex , and the head is flattened into a central depression .

On September 4 , the regiment captured Hill 971 , the highest point on the Nam River , from the US 24th Infantry Regiment . The next day , the regiment advanced along the coast , encountering stiff resistance from the ROK II Corps . In a series of engagements on September 5 , the regiment captured more than 100 prisoners , including American soldiers , and inflicted heavy casualties on the ROK 1st Cavalry Division . In a battle that lasted for about an hour , the regiment lost 18 killed and 29 wounded .

The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished . <eos> North Korean forces in the area around Taegu held out against strong resistance from the US 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK 1st Division for the next two days . On July 25 , the ROK 1st Division and the ROK 3rd Division , which had been ordered to the Pusan Perimeter , were defeated by the ROK 3rd Division at the Battle of Masan . The Americans occupied Masan the next day , with the ROK 3rd Division capturing Chinju the next day . In the meantime , the 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to withdraw from Masan and P 'ohang @-@ dong to Kyongju . This left the ROK 1st Division in control of the Masan perimeter . <eos> In a series of engagements on July 26 , the 1st Cavalry Division fought off repeated North Korean attacks , but suffered heavy casualties . The 1st Cavalry Division was ordered to withdraw from Masan on July 27 , and a week later the ROK 1st Division captured Chinju . That night , a large North Korean force under the command of Major General Masao Maruyama advanced south from Masan . Maruyama 's troops were able to destroy a railroad bridge over the Naktong River , and although they came under heavy fire from North Korean artillery , they held their ground . The next day , a second attempt to cross the river failed when a mine exploded , killing or wounding hundreds of men . This was followed by another attempt on July 28 , but this time the North Koreans were able to repel a third North Korean attack . <eos> In the meantime , elements of the 1st Cavalry Division , which had been sent to the Pusan Perimeter to reinforce the US 3rd Division , were ordered to withdraw from Masan on July 29 . The ROK 1st Division , which had been in the Pusan Perimeter , was also ordered to withdraw from Masan on July 30 . With the withdrawal of the ROK 1st Division , the Pusan Perimeter and the Naktong River , the US 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK 3rd Division were able to repel a North Korean attack on the Masan perimeter .

magical place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series production designer Michael Pickwood , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and moodier " and provide an easier access to the " gallery " of the ship . <eos> The six @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) model of the torpedo was designed by Tommaso Pola , who had previously worked on a number of designs for minelayers . He chose the dark blue colour scheme because it reminded him of the 1940s soft @-@ sandalwood used in Southampton , England . The designers also wanted to make the ship look like a Victorian Gothic revival ship , as they believed that " essentially the [ look ] is something more than a modernised version of a classic Victorian ship " . <eos> The inside of the torpedo was painted in deep blue to give the appearance of deep ocean water . In order to achieve this , the designers had to have translucent skin around the torpedo , which was chosen because it would be easier to see through than a normal torpedo . This also meant that the reflective material on the inside of the torpedo would give the impression of insulating the ship against the dark ocean . The designers had also been looking for a way to have the glow of deep ocean water appear on the inside of the torpedo , but it was decided that this would be too distracting . <eos> The designers used LEDs to give the impression of shadow , and because the light reflected off the bottom of the torpedo was so strong that it obscured the paint scheme , they had to add some form of strobe light to give the impression of a glow . In order to achieve this , the designers placed LEDs around the torpedo , which were then tinted to give the impression of deep ocean water . The production team also used dyes to create a " warmer " glow , which was achieved by applying incandescent lamps , and some lights were added to give the impression of shadow . <eos> The ship 's interior was designed to be devoid of any visible light , so that light from the outside of the ship could penetrate the spaces between the torpedo and the light inside it . In order to do this , the designers placed plywood inside the torpedo to give the impression of " gaps " between the torpedo and the light inside it . This was achieved by attaching strips of fabric to the bottom of the torpedo , and using rubber bands to attach the bands to the sides of the torpedo . The fabric was also used to make the glow glo

Under the reign of Maximilian I , Italy was ruled by an empire which , according to George Bentham , " spurned imperial ambitions and went on to become the most powerful state in Europe " . The failure of the campaign in Taranto , however , has been seen as a setback for the Empire , since Venice had turned its attention to internal affairs and engaged in policy deliberations with Austria . <eos> Despite this , the failure of the campaign in Taranto and the annexation of Austro @-@ Hungarian territory by Venice in 1509 were seen as signs of a decline in Imperial power in Italy . The same year , George Bentham also wrote that " without [ the Empire 's ] support , [ Italy ] would have been forced to abandon its pre @-@ eminent position in Europe " . <eos> The main reason for the failure of the campaign in Taranto was the fact that Venice and Austria @-@ Hungary were not yet at war with each other . An Austrian army under Tegetthoff advanced through southern Italy in 1509 , only to be defeated by a Venetian force under Achille Gregorio in 1509 . By the end of the year , Venice had captured Brindisi , Genoa , Mantua , Mantua , Verona , Naples , Genoa , Bologna , and Bari . The Austrians then turned their attention to Durazzo , where they defeated the Venetians at the Battle of Lodi in 1509 . <eos> In 1509 , Austrian forces under Archduke Maximilian I invaded Italy .

The two cruisers left the island the next day , heading for Ulithi , where they rendezvoused with the destroyers España and Ramón Díaz . While en route , the destroyers encountered the British cruiser HMS Glasgow , which was patrolling offshore . Glasgow opened fire at 01 : 15 , but both sides fired their main guns at each other for unknown reasons . At 01 : 20 , San Juan fired a salvo at Glasgow , which missed . The destroyers then turned north to pursue the British cruiser , which scored two hits on Glasgow and damaged her steering . As a result , San Juan was forced to turn back north to avoid Glasgow . At 01 : 25 , Bahía Blanca came within range of the destroyers and fired two salvos at Glasgow , which hit her with splinters . One shell penetrated the bow and detonated a torpedo bulkhead , killing or wounding everyone on board . The ship 's captain ordered that the rest of the destroyers be sunk , but as Bahía Blanca was still en route , she reversed course to head for Ulithi . <eos> During the battle , San Juan fired nine salvos at Glasgow , which hit her with splinters . One shell penetrated the upper deck and detonated a torpedo bulkhead , killing or wounding everyone on board . The ship 's captain ordered that the rest of the destroyers be sunk , but Bahía Blanca was able to continue on , reaching Ulithi on 1 July . During the battle , the destroyers fired eighteen salvos at Glasgow , which hit her with splinters . One shell penetrated the bow and detonated a torpedo bulkhead , killing or wounding everyone on board . Bahía Blanca then headed for Ulithi on 5 July , where she joined the destroyers San Juan and Ramón Díaz . The two cruisers then headed for Invergordon , where they were joined by the destroyers Areva and Diana . They reached Ulithi on 6 July . <eos> On 11 July , the destroyer
sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the Japanese were withdrawing and A Company was ordered to withdraw . The two companies followed this order and fought their way back to the main body of A Company . By 01 : 00 A Company had reached the outskirts of Hill 971 , where it was joined by C Company . This company held its position until dusk when it withdrew . <eos> Japanese resistance continued throughout the day and night . At 04 : 00 A Company held its position until dusk when it was ordered to withdraw . At dawn on 5 September , Japanese mortar fire began to fall on the Australians , killing two men and wounding several others . At dawn on 6 September , Japanese machine gun fire began to fall on the Australians , killing one man and wounding four others . At dawn on 7 September , a platoon from C Company held its position until nightfall when it was ordered to withdraw .

The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter , and " virtually every available weapon was used to destroy these enemy positions . " <eos> In the meantime , elements of the NK 6th Division were ordered to attack P 'ohang @-@ dong from the north . This was an extremely risky operation , as the US 1st Cavalry Division , under the command of Major General William B. Kean , was already well prepared for any attack . The division 's main objective was to capture P 'ohang @-@ dong and Moon 's mountain passes , which were vital for advancing North Korean forces on the ridges north of the Nam River . Although the terrain on the hills were unsuitable for such a large attack , the terrain also allowed the NK 6th Division to quickly move up the hills and outflank the US 1st Cavalry Division . <eos> <eos> = = Battle = = <eos> <eos> <eos> = = = Preliminary moves = = = <eos> <eos> The first major action of the day was the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong on 10 September . In a series of engagements that lasted from 12 to 14 September , the North Korean 6th Division advanced south from the Nam River , and their main objective was to capture P 'ohang @-@ dong . On the morning of 10 September , the North Korean 4th Division launched its attack , supported by naval and air support . The US 1st Cavalry Division advanced in two columns , supported by artillery and tanks , in an attempt to envelop P 'ohang @-@ dong . However , in the face of superior North Korean resistance , the division 's attack was repulsed , and the North Koreans were able to repel the US 4th Division 's attack . <eos> In the meantime , elements of the NK 6th Division attempted to break through the US 1st Cavalry Division 's lines , but were repulsed by the US 24th Infantry Regiment . The regiment 's main objective was to capture P 'ohang @-@ dong , which was held by the North Korean 4th Division . With the arrival of the US 1st Cavalry Division , the North Korean

With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the open ocean , and new designs were being developed for long @-@ range commerce raiding . <eos> In 1875 , with the advent of the steam engine , " plus the need to keep pace with the prevailing wind " , with 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) of coal being needed , this required a ship with the capacity to carry 6 @,@ 000 long tons ( 6 @,@ 205 t ) of coal . The American inventor James Clerk Maxwell proposed a design that would have used an ironclad , but with three guns instead of two , and these were chosen because they were cheaper to produce and more reliable . <eos> In 1876 , the British naval architect Sir William Crooke was commissioned to build a new ship for the Royal Navy . The basic design was based on the Cassin @-@ class ironclads , but a number of changes were made to improve the firepower of the ships . In 1877 , a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) gun was added to the bow , and a pair of revolving cannon were added to the stern . In 1878 , a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 4 @,@ 205 t ) ironclad was built for the Royal Navy , but it was not completed until 1886 . <eos> The first modern warship , HMS Dreadnought , was launched in 1881 , and completed in 1888 . Dreadnought entered service with the Royal Navy in 1889 , as the lead ship of her class . In 1893 , she became the first warship to be fitted with a ram bow , a new arrangement that increased her displacement to 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 510 t ) .

. " Ser <unk> " was Dante 's way of addressing <unk> Latini , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for sodomy . Eliot , in a letter to John Hayward dated 27 August 1942 , described Dante as " one of the most brilliant and original characters in English literature " . Dante is often compared to Sophocles , whose life is characterized by impetuous passion and untiring devotion . <eos> Dante 's primary source of inspiration is the Book of Hours , which Dante first read in the early morning of 24 August 1942 . The book describes Dante 's daily life as a solitary existence , devoid of any social activity . In a later letter , Dante expresses his admiration for the beauty of nature and humanity , comparing it to the immensity of alchemy . In a later letter , Dante expresses his hope that " this world will be like a vast cylinder of air " . <eos> Dante is often compared to Saint Paul , whose life is characterized by impetuous passion and untiring devotion . In a letter to W. H. Auden dated 20 September 1942 , Dante expresses his admiration for Saint Paul 's genius and compares him to Saint Cecilia , whose life is characterized by passion and untiring devotion . In another letter , Dante expresses his hope that " this world will be like a great cylinder of air " . <eos> Dante 's primary source of inspiration is the Book of Hours , which describes Dante 's daily life as a solitary existence , devoid of any social activity . In a letter to Henry Chancellor , dated 20 October 1942 , Dante expresses his admiration for Saint Paul 's genius and compares him to Saint Cecilia , whose life is characterized by passion and untiring devotion . In another letter , Dante expresses his hope that " this world will be like a great cylinder of air " . <eos> Dante 's primary source of inspiration is the Divine Comedy , which was first published in Dante 's lifetime . Dante presents a fictionalized version of the book in Dante 's Inferno . The book contains twelve chapters and Dante presents an alternate version of the book in a later version . Dante presents the fictional version of the book as an allegory for the eternal flame , while Saint Cecilia 's life is portrayed as a reflection of the human condition . <eos> Dante also has literary associations with primordial spirits , such as Helios , Bacchus , Hercules , and Ovid .

That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical storm , assigning it the name Imbudo . At 0600 UTC on July 13 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 07W , which was assigned the name Imbudo at that time . The storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to its north , and gradually intensified . Early on July 14 , the JMA upgraded Imbudo to a typhoon , estimating peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Around that time , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) . <eos> Around that time , the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear , and the JMA downgraded Imbudo to a tropical depression by 0600 UTC on July 15 .

It is often the case that an individual 's identity should be distinct from its group members , but this can be difficult to achieve in practice . This can be achieved by choosing an appropriate name for the group , such as <unk> or the recto , and , if appropriate , by having a clear distinction between the members of a group and its members . It is also possible to have a clear distinction between groups with similar geographical origins , such as Ophiostoma , which has at least one population in Iran , and <unk> , which has no population in Iran . An example of this is the Tarahob Foundation , which has at least three populations in Iran . Similarly , it has a population in Somalia , which has no population in Somalia . It also has a population in Bhutan , which has no population in Bhutan . <eos> An alternative way of dividing a group is to use a simplified form of identity based on the members of a group , such as a tributary or de facto <unk> .

The binary search algorithm , developed by Mathematica in 1988 , uses the notion of an element to represent the value of a binary variable ( e.g. , x ) , and an element to represent the value of a variable ( e.g. , y ) . <eos> The binary search algorithm is sometimes referred to as the Shapley – Folkman algorithm , or simply the Binet – Jolley algorithm . The Shapley – Folkman algorithm adjusts the sequence of elements in a string to its position in the array of its keys , the first element being searched for by the binary search algorithm . In contrast to the Shapley – Folkman algorithm , which uses mnemonic input and output data , binary search uses associative arrays of elements , each containing a unique value , that are stored in a memory location , called the binet array . The data stored in the binet array is then searched for the next element in the array , the value of the next element being searched for by the binary search algorithm . <eos> The Shapley – Folkman algorithm has been used to find values of binary variables that have the same name as the first two elements of a string , such as x and y .

edit suite . Instead , Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines . In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit . The director also used reels of several other films to create a sense of realism and go beyond mere spectacle . Mendes 's use of close @-@ ups , close @-@ ups and album cuts was the first time he had used this technique . <eos> When creating the score , Mendes first tried to find a way to convey the emotion of the film without overdoing it . He then tried to incorporate <unk> into the shots , but found that many of the characters were too small and silent . This resulted in many camera movements and camera angles that required re @-@ takes . This was a challenge for Mendes , who wanted to make the film " feel like a real , cinematic experience " . The " unnatural " camera angles were also a challenge , as he had to keep the speed of the film down to create the illusion of movement . Mendes found that many of the actors in the film did not understand what they were doing . He also tried to incorporate binaural effects into the score , but found that this was too difficult . Mendes later said that he " couldn 't do it all the time " . <eos> The first scene in the film was the climactic battle between Chopper and Espinoza , which had to be filmed over a period of several days . This was Mendes 's first time using close @-@ ups and album cuts . He later said that he " couldn 't get enough of it " . The climactic battle scene was inspired by a real @-@ life incident in which American soldiers were killed by snipers during the Vietnam War . Mendes wanted to create a cinematic experience that would not be seen by the audience , but instead be emotionally connected to the characters . He used practical effects to create a sense of realism and pathos , as well as wordless camera movements . <eos> The film was shot on 35 mm film . This required six weeks of shooting , which was Mendes 's longest schedule . He used practical effects to create a " really moving , haggard feel " . This required him to re @-@ shoot an entire day 's work for hours , so that he could focus on the action and have a better understanding of the characters . For example , he sho

the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero 's life , so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced . <eos> Nero , however , did not know this , and at some point during the negotiations with Claudius he was informed that the two sides were on a war . This eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio on 3 May 1504 , which guaranteed the succession of Claudius to the throne , and removed the last obstacle to Nero 's ambitions . <eos> <eos> = = Later life = = <eos> <eos> After Nero 's death , Claudius became one of the most powerful men in Rome . He was appointed governor of Britannia in 1505 , and again in 1506 . During his reign , he acquired a reputation as a ruthless tyrant , whose brutality was described by Tacitus as " without parallel in the history of Rome " . Nero , however , adopted a more lenient approach to punishment than Claudius , and maintained an aggressive policy towards the people . He maintained that a tyrant should be punished for the crimes he committed , rather than for the crimes he provoked . <eos> Nero was assassinated on 31 December 1508 at the Battle of Pontus , during which he and his men were captured by the Roman army . The assassins planned to kill Claudius and seize his body , but the conspirators discovered that Claudius was alive and not captured . When they discovered that Claudius was alive , they executed him .

Keiser decided the patrol should cross the river at the <unk> ferry . The 9th Infantry reserve , commanded by Major General William S.

The American position was surrounded by dense jungle , and there were no signs of American resistance . This made Coulter believe that the Americans were retreating , and he sent a patrol to investigate . This patrol came under heavy fire from machine gun and rifle fire , but Coulter did not believe that the Americans were retreating .

. <eos> Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel from being filled by sparks from under the muzzle . The introduction of cannonballs in the late 17th century also increased the firepower of the ironclads . Cannonballs were lighter and more powerful than projectiles , which increased the range of their fire . Cannonballs could be fired from any angle up to 20 ° , although this was not widely adopted until the mid @-@ 18th century . Cannonballs were also lighter and faster than projectiles , which increased the range of their fire . Cannonballs could be reloaded at a rate of two or three times faster than projectiles , which increased the rate of fire of their fire . Cannonballs were also lighter and faster than ironclads , which increased the range of their fire . Cannonballs could be fired from long range , which made them useful for close @-@ range defense against naval attack . Cannonballs were also lighter and faster than ironclads , which made them useful for land operations . <eos> Since the mid @-@ 18th century , most artillery had been made of wood , and as a result the development of cannons was slow . The earliest cannonballs were fired from trebuchet holes , which became more common after the end of the 18th century . Since then , trebuchet holes have been used as secondary firing platforms . Cannonballs are still commonly used for land operations , although they are rarely fired from cannons . <eos> <eos> = = Development = = <eos> <eos> Cannonballs were first developed in the late 17th century , when John Constable developed a gunpowder cannonball .

During the French Revolutionary Wars , the development of cannonballs was halted , as was the outbreak of the War of 1812 . Cannonballs were used in both wars , and they were particularly effective against the British Army . The development of cannonballs in the late 18th century , however , did not begin until the mid @-@ 19th century . <eos> Cannonballs were first developed in the late 17th century , when " junction stones " were used to fire a round shot at

These three volumes featured most of the original poets , ( also including imagist poetry by the American poet John Gould Fletcher ) , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the Imagist name from her publications and instead use the pseudonym " The Washing Pot " . <eos> As a result of these changes , and because Pound was reluctant to publish translations of works by other authors , she kept a journal of her own , though she and other critics have suggested that this may have been an attempt to conceal her disdain for formalism . For example , Edith Atkins suggests that Pound 's friend William Wordsworth may have thought Pound " feeble " and in 1819 published a poem called " The Raven " . <eos> In the early 1840s , Pound began to write poetry for an increasing number of people , including women , children , and wealthy patrons . She was particularly interested in unusual subjects , such as aborigines , basketry , the poor , and patriots . As early as 1843 , she had begun to study some of the works of Puritan poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge , and published a poem called " The Country Wagon " . <eos> In 1848 , Pound began to write poetry for " Whig Party " , an anti @-@ war party founded by Samuel Johnson .

The first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the TARDIS to its interior , with the implication of the Doctor standing in a doorway to confront the viewer . This effect was used for the opening scene of the episode , where the TARDIS opens and closes the doors to the Doctor .

They weren 't sure what it was going to be like , but I think it was interesting to see what people could do with it . " He and Mendes discussed the idea of turning Glee into a musical , which they did in February 1999 .
